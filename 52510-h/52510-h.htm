  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I<br /> THE ALCHEMIST</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Magister Gustave Vanderlinden, astrologer
and alchemist to that great Protestant
Prince, His Highness Augustus, Elector of Saxony,
sat somewhat gloomily in the laboratory of his house at
Leipsic.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was August, and the sun fell merrily through the
diamond panes of the casements on to the dusty and
mysterious objects which filled the high and narrow
chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>In one corner stood a large furnace with two ovens,
a tripod and pot, and a wide chimney above; on the
shelves near, on the ground, and on the fire were all manner
of vessels and pots and retorts of glass, of porcelain, and
of metal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near by stood a large quadrant, beautifully engraved,
a huge celestial globe swung in a frame of polished ebony,
a small telescope of brass and wood, and a little desk
or table covered with curious objects such as compasses,
a large portion of loadstone, several seals, drawings,
diagrams, and charts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other end of the room was occupied by a large and
fine clock of very exact workmanship, and two shelves
of rare books and manuscripts in Greek, Latin, Hebrew,
English, French, German, and High Dutch.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond, a door opened into an inner room stored with
chemicals, vases, jars, and boxes in considerable confusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The owner of this apartment was a man in the prime
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>of life, tall and spare, wearing a long, plain, frieze gown
and a flat black velvet bonnet, round his neck hung a
charm consisting of several Hebrew letters on a fine gold
chain; his face was thin, and his expression discontented
and weary.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was, indeed, an unsatisfied man; though he held
a good position at the Electoral Court, and the Elector
never undertook any action without consulting his charts,
it was neither in philosophy nor astrology that his interest
lay. He was an alchemist, and his life was devoted to
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum opus</span></i>‚Äîthe discovery of the wonderful stone
which should heal all diseases, turn all metal to gold fairer
than that found in the earth, and confer eternal youth‚Äîthe
secret of secrets of Aristotle, the goal of Hermetic
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had traversed the greater part of Europe on this
quest, and even travelled in the East, gaining much curious
knowledge and meeting other Hermetic philosophers, but
twenty years of wandering had brought him no nearer
his object, and poverty had driven him to his native land
and to the protection of the Elector.</p>

<p class='c000'>Within the last few days an experiment which consisted
of the combination of the essential mercury, silver, oil
of olives, and sulphur‚Äîso many times distilled, rectified,
dissolved, and fused, that the process had taken three
years‚Äîhad utterly failed in the final projections, and the
baffled alchemist was struggling with a despair not unmixed
with bitterness, the bitterness of the continued
barrenness of his long, earnest, and painful labours.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was roused from his weary, almost apathetic musings
by one of his assistants coming to tell him the Elector
was below. Vanderlinden rose with a sigh, pulled off his
black cap, and went down into the humble parlour where
His Highness waited.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The experiment?" asked the Elector, as the philosopher
entered his presence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It has failed, Highness," replied Vanderlinden; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>very much disliked discussing with a layman the Great
Act, the holy and mysterious science, but could not refuse
to do so with the patron who supplied the money for
these experiments. To his present relief the Elector made
no further comment on the eternal search for the philosopher's
stone; he merely shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, I did not come to talk of that," he said, "but
of the wedding."</p>

<p class='c000'>Vanderlinden repressed a sigh; there was no need to
ask whose wedding his master referred to. To all Saxony,
nay, to all Germany and the low countries, it was <em>the</em>
wedding; it had been in debate for nearly three years,
and during that period the Elector had consulted his
astrologer so frequently on the likely success, failure, or
general results of this union, that he had a whole cabinet
of charts and diagrams by which the fortunes of the
famous couple had been told according to every possible
form of divination, and the chances, good and evil, of the
marriage had been expounded in every possible way.
Vanderlinden had discussed it, argued it with his master,
drawn horoscopes of bride and groom, exhausted his skill
in foretelling their future, and, therefore, he was heartily
tired of the subject, and his spirits fell when he heard his
master again introduce it. He wished the interview over
and himself back at his books‚Äîhe had suddenly recalled
that in the works of Raymond Lully he had once seen a
good formula for making the famous red and white powder
which is the first step towards the stone itself‚Äîbut he
had to conceal his impatience, for the marriage was as
important to the Elector as the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum opus</span></i> was to the
philosopher.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," continued His Highness, "I wish to be further
heartened, encouraged, and advised about this marriage."</p>

<p class='c000'>He leant back in his chair and keenly looked at the
alchemist. He was a fine knight of great bodily strength
and pleasing appearance, his expression and manner conveyed
force and dignity and a kind of candid simplicity;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>he was a strict Protestant according to the Augsburg
Confession, and, amid the confusion of creeds that then
bewildered men, he stood out clearly as one of the foremost
Princes of Germany to defy the Pope and support
the Reformed Faith; this was his great, perhaps his only,
distinction.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wish you," he added thoughtfully, "to draw me
another chart, and to once more try if the numbers promise
good luck or ill."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay," replied Vanderlinden hastily, "I have done all
that is possible, Highness; it is but folly to again and
again search for an answer to the same question. By
no method I tried did I get a result‚Äîtherefore this marriage
will mean confusion, or else the future of it is hid from us."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Elector was not satisfied with this ambiguous
answer; he wanted a definite reply from his oracles, a
direct announcement from the fates.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sat a little while gloomily, his blunt-featured face
overcast, meanwhile the alchemist standing patiently
before him, fingering the flat black cap.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You know well enough," remarked the Prince at
length, "that if I could send some well-tested augury,
some pleasant prophecy to the Landgrave of Hesse, it
might overcome some of the bitterness of his opposition."</p>

<p class='c000'>Vanderlinden doubted this; he had himself been sent
as an envoy to Cassel with the mission of trying to persuade
the old Landgrave to give his consent to this marriage
that was so near the Elector's heart, and he had found
Philip of Hesse extremely determined and not a little
bigoted.</p>

<p class='c000'>He ventured to say as much.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I know," replied the Elector. "He has indeed made
such a sturdy opposition that I have been tempted to wish
him taken to his rest this last year."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But why does Your Highness still trouble about the
obstinacy of the Landgrave Philip when you have decided
on the wedding, when the very cakes are being baked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>the dresses made, and the groom is already on the road?"
asked the alchemist wearily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I trouble," said His Highness, "because all the responsibility
is mine, and it is no light responsibility to wed
the daughter of the Elector Maurice to a Papist Prince."</p>

<p class='c000'>Vanderlinden had heard the Elector say this many times
before; he certainly thought that this match was about as
incongruous as any could well be‚Äîan opinion shared by
most of the Elector's subjects‚Äîfor it meant uniting the
Lady Anne, daughter of the Great Prince who had checked
and humiliated Charles V, with a Romanist noble who had
been page to that Emperor and was now high in favour
with King Philip, his son; but the alchemist had, as did
others, to bow to the reasons, personal and political, which
had caused the Elector to urge on this marriage in face of the
equally stern opposition of the Romish King of Spain and
the Protestant Landgrave of Hesse‚Äîthe grandfather and
part guardian of the bride. He therefore took refuge in
a vague answer‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness has successfully overcome all difficulties,
and there is little use in repenting at the last
minute‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not repent," interrupted the Elector, rising and
frowning, "but I have taken a great deal on myself, and in
such matters it is ill to stand alone."</p>

<p class='c000'>The alchemist had no consolation to offer, no advice to
give, since both advice and consolation had long ago been
exhausted. It seemed, too, mere weakness on the part of
the Elector to still be torturing himself with doubts as to
the wisdom of a marriage which could not now be prevented.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you ready the talisman for the bride?" asked the
Elector abruptly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vanderlinden drew from the pocket of his robe a box-wood
case about an inch square, and gave it to his master.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince opened it and took out the jewel it contained:
this was a triangle of gold to represent the Trinity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>inter-clasped by a green enamel serpent, symbol of eternity
(since it had its tail in its mouth and therefore neither
beginning nor end), in the middle of the convolutions of
the reptile was a clear diamond (for purity) set on a little
square of virgin gold which bore the Hebrew letters signifying
"God Guard Thee."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Elector turned the curious little jewel, which was
carefully and beautifully fashioned, about in his strong
soldier's fingers and examined it with an air of approval.</p>

<p class='c000'>"God grant," he said, in a tone of sincerity, "that this
keep her from Popish errors and follies; but it is difficult
for a young maid to stand alone in a foreign country and
not follow the ways of it, eh, Vanderlinden?"</p>

<p class='c000'>He placed the little case in the embroidered purse that
hung at his waist, gave the alchemist a preoccupied farewell,
and left the house with a heavy step and a little click
of his long gilded spurs. Vanderlinden waited until he
heard the clang of His Highness's horse's hoofs over the
cobbles, then he returned to his laboratory.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of his assistants, young Hans Gottman, was leaning
from the window watching the departure of the Elector,
another was heating over the clear furnace some clay vases
sealed with lead.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vanderlinden caught Hans Gottman by the white apron.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Fetch me the manuscripts of Rhasis, Alfarabi and
Geber," he said. "They are locked in the chest in the
still-room."</p>

<p class='c000'>Young Hans withdrew his head and shoulders from the
window.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You know those sages by heart, master," he replied,
half in irony, half in flattery.</p>

<p class='c000'>"True," replied Vanderlinden, "but there may be
something the meaning of which I have not completely
understood, and it is very necessary that we start another
experiment at once."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The last cost thirteen thousand thalers," remarked
the young man doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>The alchemist frowned away this unpleasant truth.
"Bring me also," he said, "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le livre de la Philosophie
Naturelle des M√©taux</span></i> of Bernard Tr√©visan, and the works
of Raymond Lully."</p>

<p class='c000'>But the young man still lingered; he was more interested
in the world about him than in the science of his
master.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Did His Highness come about the marriage?" he
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The alchemist vented on his assistant the impatience he
had concealed from the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Am I never to hear the last of this marriage?" he cried.
"I would the maid was wedded and gone, then maybe we
should have a little peace in Leipsic."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But it is a wicked thing," cried Hans, "to marry a
Princess of the true faith to a Popish noble‚Äîa friend of
King Philip, a friend of the Bishop of Arras‚Äîone who hates
the Reformed Religion. I have some right to talk, master,
for my father fought under the Elector Maurice against
the late Emperor. Who thought then that the only child
of the Elector would wed with the minion of the Emperor?
A shame and a scandal it is to the country, and His Highness
should be above sacrificing a young maid to the
idolaters‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus grumbling he went into the still-room to search for
the manuscripts his master required. The other assistant,
a stout young Burgundian, by name Walter de la Barre,
had now brought his pots to the right heat and set them
aside to cool.</p>

<p class='c000'>He came forward, wiping his hands which were stained
with clay and lead.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Did the Elector command you to the feast, Magister?"
he asked. "I heard to-day it was to be in the town hall,
for the palace is not large enough‚Äîand all attending are
to bring their own butlers and cooks and plate, and there
is to be a three days' tourney‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Walter! Walter!" interrupted Vanderlinden sternly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>"Is it a wonder that your metals will not fuse, your minerals
dissolve, that your liquids turn, and your furnaces fall out
when your head is full of such idleness as this?</p>

<p class='c000'>"How often have I told you that it is the spirit and not
the mind shall conquer in this pursuit of ours? Leave
these worldly, silly things and fix your thoughts on the
great mystery, the awful secret which God is pleased to
withhold from us."</p>

<p class='c000'>The young man flushed, and turned again to his furnace
which he was keeping at white heat for the melting of more
lead wherewith to seal a further row of pots containing
a strange solution with which Vanderlinden was experimenting.
Hans returned with the three rolls of manuscript
and the book. The alchemist, with a severe injunction to
them to keep up the furnace and refrain from idle speech,
withdrew to his private chamber in the roof or gables,
where he usually meditated and struggled with the problems
he discovered in the mystical writings and oblique
instructions, veiled hints and tortuous references of the
ancient sages and masters.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two young men, as soon as they were alone, at
once went to the window and leant out, squeezing themselves
together with some difficulty, for the casement was
narrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The furnace made the chamber intolerably hot, and both
sighed with relief at the comparative coolness of the
summer breeze on their flushed faces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leipsic‚Äîroofs, gables, towers, spires‚Äîspread before
them, pleasantly glimmering in the gold dust of the heat
and softly outlined against the rich blue of the August sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was an air of festival, of languor, of midsummer
joyousness abroad, the little figures below in the street
all looked as if they were making holiday; it seemed as if
no one in the city was working, troubling, or grieving.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two youths at the window sighed with contentment,
rested the elbows of their stained sleeves on the warm sill,
and forgot the furnace, the chemicals, the minerals, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>all the materials of the vases, pots, and bottles in the
chambers behind them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I were a knight," said Hans, "I would offer myself
as a champion to the Lady Anne to challenge this Romanist
and rescue her from him. What would she be doing now,
Walter‚Äîweeping perhaps?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you ever seen her?" asked the Burgundian.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Never; she is kept close in the castle, poor soul."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, it is a cruel thing," agreed Walter, "to exile a
young girl from her home and her faith for some whim of
policy no one understands."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay, the reason is simple," replied Hans. "If the
Lady Anne were to marry a German Prince who might
put forward some claims, what of the Elector's position?
whereas wedded to a great foreign noble she will give her
uncle no trouble at all, at least so said Graf von Gebers to
the master the other day, and he added he would not
marry his daughter to a Papist to save his head, but then,
as I said, the Elector is afraid‚Äî‚ÄîIf the Lady Anne
had been a man she would have had Saxony."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But these great ones," remarked Walter, "they marry
regardless of their faith."</p>

<p class='c000'>"As to that," said Hans wisely, "all is confusion. A
king will burn at the stake a subject who is of the true faith,
yet take a Protestant to wife if it suits him. Who shall
explain these great ones? But it is an ill thing," added
the young man earnestly, "to ask a man to die for what
he believes and then to wed his Princess to one of those
who are his executioners. King Philip burns the Protestants
whenever the Holy Inquisition can seize them,
yet our Protestant Princess is to be wed to the friend
of King Philip!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"A question of policy," said the young Burgundian
vaguely. "They always say that‚ÄîState reasons‚Äîpolicy."</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>I</em> say it is a cursed marriage and one which God will not
bless," returned the Lutheran with some heat.</p>

<p class='c000'>"So declares the old Landgrave Philip," remarked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Walter, "but what is the use? And we may as well see
the festivities, I hear they are to cost a hundred thousand
thalers‚Äîand a three days' tourney‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"For the great ones‚Äîwhere will there be a place for you
or I?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, like enough we shall get on behind the rope as well
as another. It would be a gracious thing to see the Elector
tilt, and the Princess will be there in her grand dress‚Äîwe
must go‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The furnace!" cried the other with a start. "If
we let that out we are not like to see much of the Lady
Anne's wedding."</p>

<p class='c000'>They withdrew their heads hastily from the window and
applied themselves to the furnace, which was already beginning
to turn a dead colour at the outside.</p>

<p class='c000'>While these two young men bent their perspiring faces
over the fire that was to be the womb (they hoped) of
the philosopher's stone, and discussed the marriage of the
Elector's ward, Philip of Spain in the Escorial, Margaret of
Parma and the Bishop of Arras in Brussels, the old Landgrave
of Hesse in Cassel, the Emperor in Vienna, and the
King of France at the Louvre were all occupied, more or
less completely, with this same marriage, for the groom
was one of King Philip's most important subjects‚Äîhis
father's most intimate page and confidant, and also, in his
own right, a person of unusual riches, power, and position,
one of the first cavaliers of his age, an extremely popular
noble, and a man already, in his first youth, distinguished
as soldier and governor; therefore all these rulers and
statesmen were so keenly considering his marriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The name of the bridegroom‚Äîa name obnoxious to the
Lutherans of Germany as belonging to a great Papist noble‚Äîwas
William of Nassau, Prince of Orange.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II<br /> FR√ÑULEIN ANNE</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>When the Elector returned to the palace occupied
by the Saxon Court during this stay in Leipsic,
he was still engaged in considering the wisdom
of this marriage of his ward.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had striven for it during three years, and he had
accomplished it in spite of King Philip, in spite of the
Landgrave of Hesse, but now, on the eve of success,
his heart misgave him.</p>

<p class='c000'>True, there was no possible objection to the marriage
from any worldly point of view. Anne of Saxony could
not hope for any better match, and so the Elector had
always argued. There remained also his strong personal
reasons for getting the girl‚Äîwhose sex alone prevented
her from filling his place‚Äîout of the country with a husband
whose interests did not lie in Germany. But there was
always the one fact that troubled the conscience and
vexed the repose of Augustus‚Äîthe fact that had caused
the old Landgrave Philip to withhold his consent and
only bestow a very chary blessing on his granddaughter‚Äîshe
was to marry a Roman Catholic Prince, a friend of
Philip, a one-time favourite of Charles; and the bridegroom's
assurances that she should be allowed to practise
according to the Augsburg Confession were extremely
vague and unsatisfactory‚Äîindeed, he had stated that
the Lutheran Princess would be expected to 'live Catholicly'
when she took up her residence in the dominions of
Philip of Spain.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>However, it was a fine marriage, a brilliant marriage,
a marriage eminently convenient to the Elector, and he
endeavoured to stifle these late doubts and scruples.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as he reached the palace he went in search of
his niece that he might at once present her with the
protective amulet, which was to preserve her from the
snares and lures of Popery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rooms were overcrowded with people; everywhere
was confusion and excitement. No one, from the scullions
to the Electress, talked of anything but the wedding;
preparations for receiving the guests, the coming and
going of armourers, tailors, cooks, confectioners, filled
the air with noise and bustle; the stewards and heralds
were overwhelmed with work; loud disputes as to the
arrangements for the feasts and tourneys echoed in the
corridors; the pages and valets were too excited to be
useful; and the women did nothing but chatter about
clothes.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Elector made his way through the confusion
and thought of the cost of his share in all this elaborate
merry-making, he, too, began to be sick of this wedding,
to wish it well over and his niece safely in the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found the Lady Anne in the dark, lofty, antechamber
of her apartments. Here the confusion of the
palace had culminated, the whole room was strewn
with dresses, hats, cloaks, and bales of stuff; waiting-women,
serving-women, and tailors were running here
and there displaying, explaining, and arranging their wares.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near the tall, pointed Gothic window stood a structure
of polished wood the shape of a gallows, and on this
elegant gibbet hung several brilliantly dressed dolls,
swinging by their necks like so many gay little corpses.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were the models showing the bride the completed
splendours of some of her bridal gowns, and she stood near
them, pulling them out on their strings and examining
them; the strong sunlight was over her and them and
lying in a pool of gold at her feet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Anne of Saxony, the heroine of this important and long-debated
marriage, whose name was now in every one's
mouth, and whose approaching union to a Papist noble
had roused the compassionate chivalry of others beside
Vanderlinden's two apprentices, was now sixteen years
of age. Being the sole child of the great Elector Maurice,
she would, if a boy, have been in the place her uncle now
held. Connected by her mother's side with the Hesses,
she was of the finest blood in Germany, and numbered
most of the great families among her kinsmen; and her
early orphanage, her high rank, the glory of her father's
fame, and this famous marriage project had made of her a
heroine in the eyes of Lutheran Germany.</p>

<p class='c000'>The maiden who stood turning over the dressmaker's
dolls looked, however, far from a heroine of any manner of
romance.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was of medium height, and her whole body was
twisted, crooked in shoulder and hip; when she walked
she halted in the fashion known in her country as the
devil's limp; her figure was thin, undeveloped; her face
pale, her features commonplace, save for the mouth,
which was abnormally wide and loose though closed with
a certain firmness; her eyes were light, large, and expressive;
her hair dull, between brown and flaxen, and growing
in a straight ugly fashion from her high brows.</p>

<p class='c000'>In her whole person there was not one charm nor grace,
ill-health had robbed her even of the bloom of her early
youth, nor did her manners or her expression compensate
for her defects; her gestures were awkward and ungraceful,
her voice shrill, and her look conveyed the utmost arrogance
and unbridled temper.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was indeed both so unattractive and so unamiable,
that the Elector had used her defects with the Landgrave
as an argument to induce him to consent to her marriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There will not be too many suitors for one crooked
in mind and body," he had said, and, looking at her now
as she stood eagerly snatching at the swinging dolls, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>scruples and regrets at having found her a Papist husband
banished in satisfaction at having found her any husband
at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gracious uncle," said Anne, giving him a quick glance,
"I am very much occupied."</p>

<p class='c000'>Augustus took no notice of this rebuke, he was used
to her curtness. She considered herself his superior, and
her haughtiness, her tempers, and her unreasonableness
had often caused the Electress to beseech her husband
to hasten, at any cost, the marriage which would relieve
them of her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have brought you the jewel which Vanderlinden
made for you," he said, and held out the little box-wood
case.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne turned from the dolls and came forward with
some interest. She wore a long gown of tawny coloured
cloth, and a white lawn wimple; the heaviness of her
attire added to her years but hardly disguised her deformity.</p>

<p class='c000'>She took the jewel-case with hands that trembled a
little, her lips were dry, her eyes bright, in her cheeks
an unusual flush showed; excitement burnt her like a
fever, her whole poor distorted body was quivering.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Elector saw this, and a strange sort of pity for his
brother's only child touched him; after all she was but a
girl, and this was three days before her wedding.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dear niece," he said, putting his great hand gently
on her crooked shoulder, "may that amulet preserve
your faith pure in the strange land and keep you safe in
body and spirit."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne laughed affectedly and gazed critically at the jewel
in her palm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is not very beautiful," she remarked.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is very potent, and I hope you will always wear it,"
replied her uncle anxiously. "And every time you look
at it, remember you were born and bred in the Reformed
Faith."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>"As to that," said Anne, "His Highness himself said
I was to read Amadis de Gaul and play the lute and enjoy
such diversions as were fitted to one of my station, and
not trouble my head about matters of religion."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne had often quoted this remark of her future husband,
and the Elector frowned to hear it again on her lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Prince spoke as a man to a child," he returned,
"but you are no longer a child and cannot reason as one.
His Highness has promised to respect your faith, and you
must respect it also in heart and in spirit, Anne."</p>

<p class='c000'>The girl carelessly placed the amulet round her neck.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, I shall do very well, dear uncle," she replied.
"I am quite content to trust to His Highness."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But it is you yourself who must keep the faith alive
within you when in the midst of idolaters," said the
Lutheran Prince sternly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You speak like Grandfather Hesse!" cried the girl
peevishly. "I believe you regret my marriage already,
but, as I wrote His Highness, God wills it, and the Devil
shall not hinder it!"</p>

<p class='c000'>His frown deepened and a flush of anger mounted to his
cheek.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I shall regret it if you behave like a wilful child, dear
niece."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have put on your amulet," returned Anne ungraciously.
"What else would you? And my serving-women
wait‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I shall not keep you from them," interrupted the
Elector, "but remember that there are more serious
matters than gowns and chains appertaining to this
marriage."</p>

<p class='c000'>With that he turned away, for he saw that to argue
further with the bride was useless, since her natural pride
and vanity had been augmented past reason by the excitement
and importance of her present position.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne was, indeed, almost beside herself. For three years
she had been bent on this marriage with all the passion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>of which she was capable. She wanted her freedom, she
wanted increased grandeur, she wanted the enjoyments
of the gay court of Brussels‚Äîof which she had heard so
much‚Äîand she believed herself violently enamoured of
the gorgeous cavalier whom she had seen once on the
occasion of his visit to Dresden and who was to be her
husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>She watched with pleasure the departure of her uncle,
and impatiently called the tailor who was responsible for
the dolls. She had some fault to find with each of them:
one model had the skirt too long, in another the colour
was hideous, the gold lacing of a third did not please her.
These objections were taken at random, for she was far
too overwrought to consider or even notice the details of
the beautiful little dresses.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the man had bowed himself out with his small
gallows full of puppets, Anne sank into one of the deep
chairs of blue-and-yellow velvet; her back ached from
standing, her head throbbed, her heavy gown dragged at
her shoulders, she had not slept for several nights and her
whole feeble body was fatigued, but she would spare
neither herself nor those who had to please her humour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Gowns, petticoats, mantles, caps, hoods, gloves, shoes,
jewels, every ornament or trinket luxury could devise
was brought before her for her inspection. She had been
most extravagant in her purchases, and it was already
said that when her debts and the feasts had been paid,
there would not be anything left of the hundred thousand
thalers that formed her dowry. Her thin, feverish fingers
handled the brocades and velvets, the silks and lawns,
the girdles and chains with a kind of eager energy, as if
these things were so many weapons she was piling up
against fate.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so unconsciously she regarded them, she meant
to be the grandest lady at the Court of the Regent; her
whole small soul was centred on this childish ambition
and had no room for any other emotion save a fierce, jealous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>but inchoate desire that her brilliant husband should
love her. She thought all this bravery would help her
accomplish both ends, and therefore devoted all her
passionate interest to these splendours of silvered silk,
Venetian velvet, cloaks of miniver and red fox, skirts of
many coloured brocade, doeskin fringed gloves and shoes
sewn with gold thread.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last her weakness could endure no more; with an
hysteric petulance that bordered on tears she dismissed
every one, and, taking the arm of her favourite waiting-woman,
she limped through the bowing ranks of tailors,
jewellers, and sewing-maids into her inner and private
chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>There she dropped into the cushion-piled chair near the
window that stood open on the sunshine, and so sat, looking
huddled and dwarfish, her right hand, sparkling with
the hard brilliance of an emerald ring, supporting her
aching head, her feet resting on a great footstool, her
knees drawn up.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waiting-woman stood at the end of the huge crimson-curtained
bed, waiting the pleasure of her mistress.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was a tall girl, subdued, quiet, patient‚Äîqualities to
which she owned the dangerous favour of capricious Anne's
preference. Her father had served under the Elector
Maurice, but returning to his native city, Ghent in the
Netherlands, he had been executed as a heretic under the
rule of the late Regent, and his entire property confiscated.
His wife had fled with her child to the Saxon Court, where
she had soon after died of her miseries, leaving her daughter
under the protection of the Electress.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the short, sad experience of R√©n√®e le Meung,
which had left her reliant, reserved, self-effacing, humble,
but passionately attached to the faith for which her parents
and her happiness had been sacrificed, and of an earnest
gravity beyond her years.</p>

<p class='c000'>She endured the whims and caprices, the tempers and
tyrannies of Anne with more than the usual submission
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>of the dependant, and her lack of vanity and her indifference
made her a foil that was precious to the arrogance
of her mistress.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e was beautiful with the opulent beauty of her
country, but she ignored it, and she had no lover, so Anne
was content to ignore it too. Besides, her own vanity was
too great for her to be aware how her own unattractiveness
was heightened by the loveliness of the graceful Fleming,
with her crimson-brown hair and eyes, her rose complexion,
her white skin, and exact features, though she was
so plain in her dress, so grave in her manner, so always
and completely in the background that many besides
her mistress might have discounted this beauty that
lacked all flash and allure.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she stood now, outwardly patiently at attention,
her thoughts were far away, returning, as always, to the
dear past when she had had a home and those who loved
her, the times when she had heard her father laugh, her
mother sing, when she had herself been full of life and
hope and all pleasantness; her present situation, that of
an exile employed by charity, she forgot‚Äîshe seemed for
a moment free, as she had once been behind the loved
walls of Ghent‚Äî‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"R√©n√®e," said Anne, opening her eyes, "the Prince
wrote to know what my colours were. When he enters
Leipsic he will have a thousand knights and gentlemen
with him‚Äîis it not magnificent?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The waiting-woman closed her thoughts.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Indeed, Your Grace is very fortunate," she answered
quietly, taking up her wearisome part of confidante. She
endured Anne's futile vanities not so much from good
humour as from sheer indifference; her disinterest in her
present life was her surest buckler against what she had
to endure.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is indeed a very splendid cavalier," said Anne,
with vast satisfaction, "and he made me such fine speeches
and compliments. I wish you had seen him when he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>came to Dresden, but you will soon see him now. And I
am higher born than he, for he is only a Count in Germany.
Yet he is a sovereign Prince too, and I shall give way to
no one at the Court of Brussels. Is it not all very
pleasant?"</p>

<p class='c000'>So the girl chattered on in her shrill, high voice, and
the waiting-woman dutifully assented to all she said;
but R√©n√®e's calm, R√©n√®e's self-effacement, usually so
grateful to Anne, to-day offended her. She wanted a more
human interest shown in her affairs, some excitement,
some envy, some jealousy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You talk as if you were sick!" she cried fretfully.
"Do you not care at all about my wedding?"</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e flushed at the rare personal address; it
was seldom Anne spoke to her as to another human
being.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of course I care," she answered gravely, "but how
can I comment on matters so much above me?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne was mollified.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Would you not like a husband, rich and handsome?"
she asked, trying to provoke the flattery of the other's
envy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I?" asked R√©n√®e, in genuine surprise. "Who will
ever marry me?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps some day I shall find some one for you. How
old are you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Twenty-five, Your Grace."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is not very young! Nearly ten years older
than I am! Is it not very fine to be married at sixteen?
Would you not like to be married soon?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I would never marry any but a Lutheran," replied
R√©n√®e calmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne flushed, and her bright eyes flashed with amazing
fury.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah! You, too, dare to blame me because the Prince
is a Papist!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>"Nay," said R√©n√®e gently. "I know there are reasons
of State."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Reasons of State?" shrieked Anne. "I love him
and he loves me! You are jealous because you will never
have such a knight!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Never, truly," replied the waiting-woman with undiminished
sweetness. "It is only great ladies like Your
Grace who can wed with such as the Prince of Orange."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You would not marry save with a Lutheran," said
Anne. "Then you would not marry the Prince?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is a jest‚Äîto suppose such a thing."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ay, but would you?" insisted Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e's native courage and honesty flashed through her
long reserve, her self-effacement.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I would not wed with a Papist were he the Emperor
himself," she replied firmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You proud hard creature!" cried Anne, vexed to
tears. "But it is all a lie‚Äîa jealous lie, you would wed
the first Papist who asked you."</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e was silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Wait until you see the Prince," insisted Anne childishly.
"There is no one like him‚Äîno one."</p>

<p class='c000'>"So I have always heard," said R√©n√®e sincerely.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Did you ever see his first wife?" asked Anne abruptly.
"Was she pretty? Did he care for her?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I never saw the first Princess, Your Grace. They
were very young when they married, and she died very soon."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, I am sure he has forgotten her. If you are so
afraid of the Papists and hate them so, why do you come
with me to Brussels?" she added maliciously.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bitter truth, "I must go where I can earn my
bread," rose to R√©n√®e's lips, but she suppressed it and
merely replied, "I am not afraid of any one corrupting
my faith, Your Grace, and I shall be with a Protestant
mistress."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I suppose you would rather stay here," said Anne,
"if you could find some Lutheran to marry, but you are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>not very young and you have red hair, therefore you must
make the best of it and come to Brussels."</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e was absolutely unmoved by her mistress's rudeness;
she hardly heard the words.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you any relations in Brussels?" asked Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No," replied the waiting-woman, "nor any in the
Netherlands. I think‚Äîwe are all scattered‚Äîwandering,
or still for ever in the grave;" then quickly changing a
subject on which she had been betrayed into speaking
with feeling, she asked, "Has His Grace's alchemist's
experiment succeeded? It was to be known whether or
no this week."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Elector said nothing to me of it," replied Anne
fretfully. "He gave me a silly little jewel Vanderlinden
made. Of course the experiment has failed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Poor alchemist!" said R√©n√®e. A vast pity for all
endeavour, all disappointment, was now her strongest
feeling; the grief of others had more power to move her
than her own distress.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne began to moan that her head was aching beyond
bearing; she indeed looked ill. There was something tragic in
her frailty and her excitement, her deformity and her vanity.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e went to fetch the sweet wine and comfits for
which she called and which were her usual medicine; as
always, she drank greedily and soon fell heavily asleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waiting-woman put back the engraved silver plate
and tankard on the black sideboard, and crept softly to the
window where the August sun might fall on her face.</p>

<p class='c000'>She turned her full gentle eyes with a great pity on the
wretched little figure of her mistress, whose thin hands were
nervously twitching, even in her sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>What could this marriage promise?‚Äîthe groom one of
King Philip's courtiers, worldly, handsome, able; the
bride this miserable, fretful, ignorant child, mad with
vanity, sick with excitement, diseased in body, unbalanced
in mind. R√©n√®e, who knew Anne as few did, was almost
sorry for the Papist Prince who could not know her at all.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>"And for such a union they rejoice and dance and hold
their jousts!" thought the waiting-woman wearily.</p>

<p class='c000'>She gazed out into the sunny air, it was near late afternoon
and very peaceful.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e did not see the towers of Leipsic; her mind spread
the world before her like a great map painted with bright
pictures‚Äîgreat tyrants slaughtering, burning, oppressing;
poor people flying homeless, dying unnoticed‚Äîeverywhere
wrong, violence, cruelty‚Äîand no one to rise against it,
no one to defy such a man as King Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one was for himself, his private gain; even the
Protestant Princes of Germany who had stood for the faith
of Martin Luther, they put their own convenience first, as
in this marriage which the Elector had urged forward for
his personal interest. There was a Protestant monarch on
the throne of England, but she remained friendly with
Catholic potentates and raised no finger to help those of
her faith so horribly persecuted.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Always policy, ambition, self-seeking," thought R√©n√®e
wearily. "Is there not <em>one</em> in all the world would stand
for his God, his country only? Not <em>one</em> to be the champion
of liberty of faith?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Not one, she believed; they kept the gaudy show of
chivalry in the tourneys and jousts, but the spirit of it was
long since lost. There were no more knights, there was no
one to stand forward for the weak and the miserable, the
humble and the helpless; the Reformed Faith had produced
saints and martyrs but not yet a champion or a protector.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They all bow to circumstance, these great princes and
nobles," thought R√©n√®e; "there is not one of them who
would endanger the tenth part of his possessions for the
cause of the poor Protestants, for liberty, for country‚Äînot
one."</p>

<p class='c000'>She leant her sick head against the mullions and closed
her eyes; life seemed so long, so futile, the world so wrong,
so ugly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There <em>have</em> been heroes," the eternal romance of youth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>whispered in her heart. "Why should not one come now
when he is so needed, ah, so sorely needed?"</p>

<p class='c000'>She opened her eyes on the sun, on the hot, silent city
with the languorous air of festival and holiday.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I ever met such an one, or knew of him, how I would
worship him!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Love she never thought of; she did not believe that it was
possible for her to ever love, but she knew that she would
gladly die for one who would champion her persecuted
faith, her oppressed country‚Äîvery gladly die, or live, in
happy abnegation in his service.</p>

<p class='c000'>The clock struck six; the tire-women entered to rouse
Anne and dress her for supper; it was Ren√©'s one time of
freedom. She hastened away before her mistress's peevish
caprice should have decided to detain her, and went forth
into the clean, bright streets.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III<br /> LOUIS OF NASSAU</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Leipsic was unfamiliar to R√©n√®e le Meung, she did
not know where the sunny streets she chose would
lead her, but as she knew no one and had no object
in her walk, this did not trouble her. She walked slowly,
enjoying the sun, which was the only thing left her to
enjoy.</p>

<p class='c000'>She did not seem a lady of the court, so simple and even
poor was her dark green kirtle and mantle, so unpretentious
her whole appearance; even if she had wished to follow
some degree of fashion she was unable to, for her sole resource
was what was given her as waiting-woman to the
Elector's niece, and that was little enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>But she was utterly unconscious of her plainness of attire
as she walked unnoticed by the hurrying crowd that now
and then pushed her against the wall or the street posts in
their haste.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one was full of the wedding and the subsequent
festivities; the name of Anne and of her groom was on
every lip; there seemed no room in Leipsic for anything
but rejoicing. The air of gaiety, of idleness, and holiday
was accentuated by the great glory of the late afternoon sun
which filled the air with golden motes, blazed in golden
flame in the casement windows, gleamed on the weathercocks,
and filled the upper boughs of the elms and chestnuts
in the squares and gardens.</p>

<p class='c000'>As R√©n√®e was turning into one of these squares she met
the Elector's alchemist walking thoughtfully under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>shade of the trees with a small brass-covered book in his
hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>She would have passed and left him to his meditations,
but he chanced to see her and instantly paused and saluted
her. He had a kindness for her; she had always been
gentle and interested in his work when they had chanced
to meet.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This may remind you," he said, holding out the little
volume, "of that wonderful Book given by a Jew to the
great Nicolas Flamel by which he finally discovered the
secret of secrets. Does he not describe it as with brass
covers, leaves of bark engraved with an iron pencil, and
symbolic pictures finely coloured?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"And he discovered the stone?" asked R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ay," answered Vanderlinden wistfully, "and in evidence
of it may be seen his statue to this day in Paris,
together with fourteen churches and seven hospitals that he
founded with the gold he manufactured."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And the secret died with him?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"He disclosed it to no one," admitted the alchemist.
"I bought this book in memory of his‚Äîit cost but two
florins and I doubt it is worth more."</p>

<p class='c000'>He put the book under his arm and asked R√©n√®e if she
would see his house, which was but a few yards away; he
had taken, he said, for his stay in Leipsic, the dwelling
of another alchemistral philosopher who had lately gone
travelling; this man had had a shop for perfumery, soaps,
and engraved gems which he‚ÄîVanderlinden‚Äîwas continuing
to hold open, and where he did some little trade
among those gathered in Leipsic for the wedding.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I would rather have stayed in Dresden," he added,
"and concluded my experiment there, but His Princely
Grace insisting on my coming hither, though not paying
my expenses of the road, so I am obliged to make what I
can with these washes and unguents."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am sorry the experiment failed," said R√©n√®e gently.
The occupation of the alchemist seemed to her more worthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>than that of most other men; at least he had set his aim
high, and was searching for what would benefit mankind as
much as it would himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps the next may succeed," answered the alchemist
diffidently, "but I doubt if God hath reserved this great
honour for me‚Äîthis high favour."</p>

<p class='c000'>They turned towards the house, which was situated at the
corner of the square, and entered the shop‚Äîa room which
was opposite the parlour where Vanderlinden had received
the Elector.</p>

<p class='c000'>This room faced west, and the full light of the setting
sun poured through the broad low window on to the
shelves where stood the pots, bottles, cases, boxes, vases
containing the alchemist's wares, and on to the long smooth
counter where the glittering scales gleamed, and where
two men were leaning over a tray of engraved gems such as
are used for signet rings.</p>

<p class='c000'>He behind the counter was the alchemist's foremost
assistant, the companion of all his wanderings, and the
sharer of his fortunes‚Äîa lean, silent Frenchman, named
Dupr√®s, who was a noted spirit raiser, and possessed a
mother-of-pearl table on which he could bring the angels
to discourse with him, and a tablet of polished jet in which
he could foresee future events.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was now engaged in holding a violet stone, clear and
pure as crystal and engraved with the first labour of
Hercules, against the strong sunlight, which flashed through
it, giving a glorious strength of colour to the little square
gem.</p>

<p class='c000'>The customer was a young cavalier, not much over
twenty, splendidly vested in black velvet cross cut over
stiff white satin; a cloak of orange cloth hung from one
shoulder, fastened across the breast with cords of gold,
three ruffs encircled his throat, the topmost or master
ruff being edged with silver lace and touching his ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>His appearance was singularly charming; though
rather below the average height, he was extremely graceful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>and he carried his small, well-shaped head with the noble
carriage of a fine stag; his features were aristocratic and
aquiline, and expressed gaiety, frankness, and good humour;
his thick, dark-brown hair fell in waves on to his ruff, and
was curled low on to the brow.</p>

<p class='c000'>His well-formed right hand lay open on the counter,
palm upwards, and was filled with the sparkle and light
of yellow and red stones.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e knew this young seigneur well; he was Louis of
Nassau, the brother and envoy of Anne's bridegroom,
whose mouthpiece and proxy he had been during the three
years of the negotiations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waiting-woman, with her instinct and training of
self-effacement, was drawing back at sight of the young
Count, but with his usual gay friendliness he rose and
addressed her, asking her opinion of the jewels before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am a poor judge of such things," smiled R√©n√®e.
"I do not know why I am here at all, save that I was
asked very courteously."</p>

<p class='c000'>She came and stood by the counter, looking, with her
habitual utter indifference, at Louis of Nassau; she did
not know much of him nor had they ever spoken together
further than a few words, but she did not like him despite
his courtesy, his charm, his undeniable attraction.</p>

<p class='c000'>And this dislike was because he, a Protestant himself,
had been eagerly forwarding the marriage of his Papist
brother with Protestant Anne, because he was known to
be looking for a wealthy bride himself, and because she
judged him frivolous, extravagant, and thoughtless.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Will you be glad, seigneur," she asked with a flicker
of curiosity, "when His Highness, your brother's wedding
is really accomplished?"</p>

<p class='c000'>He raised his fresh young face quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I shall be glad?" he said, and for the first time
R√©n√®e noticed the lines of fatigue and anxiety beneath the
brilliant eyes and on the fair brow.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We shall all be glad," said Dupr√®s, with the freedom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>he always assumed, "when the little lady is safely in the
Netherlands."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not I," said R√©n√®e. "I would rather live in Saxony
than Brussels."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Does the Lady Anne hold that opinion?" asked the
Count.</p>

<p class='c000'>The question at first amazed R√©n√®e, then she swiftly
recalled how Anne had been shut away and guarded by
the Elector (her sickly unattractiveness being more
hedged about than beauty, for fear reports of her should
reach and disgust her prospective husband), and that
Louis could only have obtained rare glimpses of her, and
never have had an opportunity to know her temper nor
her mind as the waiting-woman knew both.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My mistress is very glad to go to Brussels, and very
devoted to His Highness," she answered conventionally,
adding, with more feeling, "She is very young, princely
Count, and frail, and the excitement of these days exalts
her spirit."</p>

<p class='c000'>"She does not regret Saxony, I think," remarked the
alchemist, "which is well for the future tranquillity of His
Highness."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nor is she afraid of a Papist Court, eh?" asked the
young Count with a frank laugh. "I believe the maiden
thinks more of her gowns and her new titles than of the
sermons and prayer books she leaves behind."</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke carelessly, slipping a ring with a dark honey
coloured stone on his finger the while. R√©n√®e wondered
at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Her Grace will remain of the Reformed Faith," she
said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'But she will live Catholicly,'" quoted the Count
with a smile. He spoke as if he was pleased (as indeed he
was) that the laborious negotiations had ended in the
Prince getting what he had been striving for from the first,
namely, the lady without any conditions as to her faith,
for a Protestant wife was obviously impossible for a noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>of King Philip. R√©n√®e had watched the troubled course
of the tangled diplomacies of guardian and suitor with
equal disdain for the Elector who gave his niece to a Papist
for his own convenience and the Prince who took a bride,
who was to him a heretic, merely because it suited his
ambitions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis of Nassau noticed her silence; he had remarked
before that she was strangely quiet and also that she was
exceedingly comely. His glance, quick to appreciate and
admire fair women, now fell kindly over her graceful
figure, her face so finely coloured and so delicate in line,
the rose carnation of lip and cheek, the glow of the heavy,
carelessly dressed hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wonder what you think of?" he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e started at the personal address, she had been so
long a mere part of the background that when one treated
her as an individual it always confused her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What should I think of, princely Count?" she answered.
"Foolish things, of course."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis handed the ring and the violet gem to Dupr√®s,
who packed them into little cases of cedar wood.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You do not look as if your thoughts were foolish," he
replied, with more gravity than she had ever associated
with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay, I think she is a very wise lady, noble seigneur,"
said the alchemist.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your thoughts, then?" smiled Louis of Nassau.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e's deep-set indifference to all things overcame her
momentary confusion.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am too good a Protestant to rejoice at this
marriage," she replied quietly, "and my thoughts were all
sad ones, noble Count, and did not in any way touch your
high policies."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis of Nassau answered gently; he knew something
of her history.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is all a question of policy certainly," he paid her
the compliment of sincere speaking. "The marriage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>suits the Elector and my brother‚Äîthe lady too, I think‚Äîand
religious differences are easily accommodated among
people of sense. The Prince is no fanatic‚Äîyour faith will
be protected as long as you are in his household. He, too,
was bred a Protestant."</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e could make no answer; she knew the Prince had
left his faith when the splendid heritages, rank, and honours
of his cousin Ren√© of Orange had fallen to him‚Äîhis father
had sent the German Protestant to the Emperor's Court
to become a Papist, and almost a Spaniard. R√©n√®e saw
nothing splendid in any of this‚Äîit was a piece with the rest
of the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You dislike my brother?" asked Louis shrewdly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I like no one," said the waiting-woman calmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you seen the Prince?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay; when His Highness came to Dresden I was very
ill."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I thought that you had not seen him," remarked
Louis. "No one who has seen him dislikes him."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You put me in the wrong," protested R√©n√®e. "Who
am I to judge great ones? Take no heed of me, gracious
Count. I am looking for a hero, and that is as hard to find
as the holy stone," she added, with a smile at the alchemist.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have been reading Amadis de Gaul, or Charlemagne
and his paladins‚Äîfie, I did not think it of your
gravity," jested Louis of Nassau.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e flushed into animation, and it was like the
sudden blooming of a tightly closed flower, so did the quick
flash of her feeling light her features into beauty.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There <em>were</em> such men," she said, "and might be again,
surely‚Äîdo you not believe so, Magister? And never were
they more needed than now‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>She checked herself sharply and the lovely flush faded.
She turned away and picked up one of the slender glass
bottles of essences Vanderlinden had placed before her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis of Nassau looked at her curiously. "She is
beautiful," he thought.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>"Perhaps one day you will find your hero and Vanderlinden
his stone," he said, and the sun flickered like a
caress over his brilliant person and his pleasant young face.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps? Nay, surely," replied the alchemist. "Or
if we do not, another will. For both are there as surely
as God is in heaven."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You, too, think the world needs some knight, some
paladin?" asked the Count, drawing on his white gloves
stitched with gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have travelled much," replied the alchemist, "and
could not avoid seeing, albeit that I was ever engaged in
abstruse studies, the great horrid cruelties and wrongs
abroad, especially under the reign of His Majesty King
Philip, in whose dominions God grant me never to set foot
again. I was in England, princely seigneur, while he was
King of that country, and I did see things that made me
weary of life. So, too, in Spain from whence I fled hastily.
And, lately, it is no better in the Netherlands; indeed there
are few places where a man can think as he please and
speak freely, save only in these states of Germany."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis of Nassau looked thoughtfully at the speaker,
and then at R√©n√®e whose fair head was bent over the rows
of alabaster pots and bottles of twisted glass and crystal.
He had never lived under a tyrant, his brief joyous life had
passed in absolute freedom, and with him his faith was not
the result of conviction but of heritage. Still the old man's
words and the girl's eloquent face were not without effect
on him; some emotion strange and vague echoed in his
heart, and he sighed as he took the two little boxes from
Dupr√®s.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There are many changes abroad," he said. "Who
knows but that this hero may appear to put straight all
these tangled wrongs."</p>

<p class='c000'>He took up his high-crowned white hat with the cluster
of black plumes, and, saluting all very pleasantly, left the
shop.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There goes no hero there at least," said Dupr√®s softly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>glancing through the window at the Count, who glittered
in the sun without. "He spent fifty thalers to-day in
unguents‚Äîconserve of violets, lotion of citrons, sweetmeats
of pistachio nut, rose and orange water!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is his brother like him?" asked R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have never seen the Prince of Orange," answered
the alchemist, but Dupr√®s, who appeared to have been
everywhere and seen every one, declared he knew the
Prince well by sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is more magnificent than Count Louis, and more
to be feared though so few years older‚Äîfor he is certainly
a great Prince. But prodigal and greatly in debt, they
say‚Äîand not very pious, nor straight-living‚Äîat least,
no more so than any man of his blood and youth."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, Dominus," said R√©n√®e, "cannot you look in your
jet tablets and see what the future of this marriage will
be?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have looked for the Elector time enough," replied
Dupr√®s with a little smile, "and saw nothing but confusion."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you tried to see the future of the poor Protestant
peoples?" asked R√©n√®e earnestly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Frenchman carefully put away the tray of gems.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is too large a thing to be looked for in a square
of jet or any magic mirror whatever," he replied.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We must look for it in our own hearts," said R√©n√®e
sadly. "Well, I have out-stayed my leisure; give me leave
to come another time and see your treasures."</p>

<p class='c000'>Vanderlinden took up a tall bottle of milk-white glass
with a stopper of scarlet porcelain and filled with jasmine
essence; he offered it to R√©n√®e with a half-awkward
kindness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waiting-woman, who never received any kind of
gift, felt the tears swiftly sting her lids.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I shall not come to see you since you treat me so well,"
she said, with an eager little smile; she did not realize
that she was the only lady who had ever come to the shop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>without a cavalier to buy gifts for her, nor that if she had
been as other women Count Louis would have offered
her as much perfumery as she could need; she was unaware
how her reserve and her indifference hedged her from
common courtesies. She did not miss gallantry and
compliments, but she often missed kindness, and therefore
the alchemist's action stirred her heart, while Count
Louis' flattery would have left her cold.</p>

<p class='c000'>She passed out into the street, the aromatic odours of
the shop still about her. She saw Vanderlinden's two
apprentices hurrying along with rosettes of Anne's colours
threaded with orange ribbons. The streets were now in
shadow, for the sun had set behind the houses, but over
all was that sense of festival, of excitement, and in the
air were the names of Anne and William of Orange.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br /> THE SAINT BARTHOLOMEW WEDDING</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Anne of Saxony stood at the top of the wide
stairs of Leipsic town hall waiting to welcome
her bridegroom; about her spread the motionless
pageantry of harquebusiers, burgher guard, nobles, gentlemen,
and pages‚Äîall ranged up the stairs and on the landings
in groups of brilliant colours and shining weapons.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was St. Bartholomew's Day, the 24th of August,
and intensely hot; the air of the town hall, though
constantly refreshed with perfume sprays, was close and
dry; through the windows, carefully shuttered against
the heat, the sun crept in through odd chinks and made
spots of dazzling gold. The pages sighed under their
breath, the gentlemen heaved their shoulders under the
heavy weight of velvet, brocade, and jewelled chains; the
ladies behind the bride swayed to and fro with little
whispers and glances among themselves; the Electress
stood slightly apart, covertly fanning herself, and lamenting
to the bride's uncle, the Landgrave William, son of the
old Landgrave of Hesse, that the electoral palace which
was so much more commodious than the town hall, should
be under repair.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bride herself stood in advance of all, on the very
edge of the top stair; her eyes were directed fiercely
down between the two rows of soldiers that glittered
against the dark wood balustrades.</p>

<p class='c000'>The long weeks of tumultuous days and sleepless nights
had reduced her feebleness to utter exhaustion, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>passionate excitement supported her, and gave her the
strength to stand there bearing the weight of her heavy
robes, the heated air, the fatigue of standing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Elector, with four thousand nobles, gentlemen, and
soldiers, had ridden to meet the bridegroom and his escort
outside the city; to those waiting here the return of
Augustus and his guest seemed wearisomely delayed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why do they not come‚Äîwhy do they not come?"
muttered Anne again and again.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e le Meung, who stood close behind, remarked
her mistress's gorgeous figure with a tired curiosity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waiting-woman was herself so remote in heart
from all this festivity which she stood in the centre of,
so far in spirit from all the excitement by which she was
surrounded, that these people seemed to her in a strange
way lifeless‚Äîsplendid puppets like those the tailor had
brought on the polished wood gallows; and when she
looked at the bride she was sorry, in a vague way, that
Anne was not more lovely, more gracious, more sweet.
The long-stifled romance of her own youth told her the
central figure of all this pageantry should be more worthy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since seven that morning Anne had stood on her feet
being attired, and it was now towards two of the clock‚Äîthe
actual time of the wedding being five.</p>

<p class='c000'>All those hours of her women's labour and fatigue,
her own screaming impatience and trembling nervousness,
had resulted in an appearance almost grotesquely brilliant.</p>

<p class='c000'>She wore a gown of stiff satin, interchangeable wine red
and yellow‚Äîthe colour of old amber; it flowed fold on fold
from her tight waist, to fall heavily on the floor, weighted
by a hem of ruby and topaz embroidery; in front it was
slightly caught up by a gold cord, to display a petticoat
of black and crimson brocade in a design of flowers, and
the pointed shoes cloth of gold with red silk tissue roses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bodice was crimson cloth of gold, cut low in the
front, and rising behind to a high upstanding collar of
finest gold lace, the full sleeves were of pale yellow satin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>laced across and across with gold and crimson cords;
round the throat and over the bosom hung strings of
pearls and rubies and long chains of curious enamel; the
dull-coloured hair was crowned by a gold cap sewn with
pearls, and long emeralds swung in the ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Anne's stooping shoulders there hung, despite the
heat, an orange mantle lined and bordered with ermine,
which lay a full yard on the polished boards behind her.
But none of this costly and princely magnificence could
disguise the thin malformed figure, and the fierce fire
of the gems only served to make the pale weary face
look like a colourless mask‚Äîand colourless she was, from
her pallid lips to her light brows‚Äîonly in her pale eyes
burned the flame of her passionate, jealous, eager soul.</p>

<p class='c000'>So she stood, waiting for her lover, as she was pleased
to consider him; and R√©n√®e was sorry for her mistress
from her heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now the doors at the foot of the stairs were opened,
and the full August sun fell on the black and orange of
the halberdiers, the spearmen, and harquebusiers, the
gleaming weapons and fluttering banners that rose above
the heads of the crowd that filled the market square.</p>

<p class='c000'>Outside the town hall the whole splendid cavalcade
had halted, and presently, through the broad shaft of
sunshine and in at the doors came the Elector, accompanied
by several other German princes and the bridegroom,
escorted by his three brothers‚Äîthe Counts John, Adolphus,
and Louis.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the foot of the stairs these gentlemen paused for a
second, and among those waiting at the top there was the
slightest movement and murmur‚Äîa bending forward of
expectant faces, the rustle of stiff satins.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was indeed great curiosity to behold the bridegroom,
many of those present having never seen him
before; R√©n√®e, more curious because more thoughtful
than the others, stepped lightly from behind her mistress
and gazed down the stairs.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>She saw one cavalier come forward from the others and
ascend the stairs a little in advance of them; this was
he whose fame had travelled so far, who had been so
criticized, so discussed in Saxony, whose marriage project
had been the subject of so many intrigues and broils in
Madrid, Brussels, and Dresden.</p>

<p class='c000'>Slowly he came up the stairs, his eyes fixed on Anne,
and himself the subject of all regards.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e watched him long, intently.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was her first sight of him, and she was long to
remember this brilliant scene, long to recall in other scenes
of terror, misery, and exaltation that figure coming up
the stairs with the blaze of sunshine and the little group
of princes behind him.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, her first impression of William of Orange, was of
a gentleman of extreme good looks with the carriage of
a soldier and the grace of a courtier. He was slender,
twenty-eight years of age, and of a Southern type‚Äîdark,
warmly coloured, with a small head and regular features,
the nose straight, the lips full, the eyes chestnut brown,
large, and well-opened; his red-brown hair was short,
thick, and curling, his beard close shaven, his complexion
dark. He wore still a simple dress of tawny velvet buttoned
high under the chin and, turning over with a little collar
of embroidered lawn, it was slashed over an under-vest
of scarlet, and the sleeves and breeches were of black silk
fretted with silver work; his one adornment was a long
gold chain of massive links, passed six times round his
neck; he carried his gloves and a black cap with a heron's
plume in his left hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Straight up the stairs he came with an ease that seemed
unconscious. Anne swayed towards him; he kissed her
cold hand, smiled at her, and stood so a moment beside
her, looking down into her pale, almost frightened, face.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that moment R√©n√®e saw, as by a sudden light, the
bride as she was in contrast with him. By the standard
of his complete manhood, his finished accomplishment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>his undeniable charm, gaiety, and power, she beheld Anne
a peevish, sickly, malicious, ignorant child, and she turned
her eyes away. This contrast of bride and groom seemed
to her to touch this mating with horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince now turned to the Electress, and Anne, with
a deep reverence to her future husband, withdrew with
her women to the apartments prepared for her use.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sooner was she there than her strained control gave
way; she scolded, she stamped, and finally broke into
hysterical tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>The frightened agitated women ran hither and thither
with cordials and essences and all the details of the resplendent
wedding-gown with which their mistress had to
be vested.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e, a little bewildered by that sight of the Prince of
Orange, went about her duties quietly; she believed she
knew the cause of Anne's untimely tears. Deep beneath
the Princess's vanities, ignorances, and arrogances lay a
woman's intuitions; these warned her, sometimes in a
manner not to be ignored, that she was crooked, undesirable,
and now they told her that the Prince's kind
glance had not been that of a lover. Anne, too, R√©n√®e
thought, had felt the bitter difference between herself and
her betrothed.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last the bride, alternately shaken by nervous temper
and stormy sobbing, was arrayed in the wedding-gown of
milk-white velvet, over-veiled with a skirt of braided
pearls, transparent silver wings rising at the back in lieu
of a ruff, and over all a train of pale purple embroidered
with crystal flowers; a wreath of myrtle twisted with an
orange ribbon was placed on the stiff waves of her crimped
hair, the traces of tears were powdered away as well as
might be, the rings, necklets, bracelets, chains were replaced.
She was perfumed with costly essence extracted
from Eastern lilies, then escorted to an upper chamber
where waited the Elector, the Electress, two town councillors,
the Prince of Orange, and his brother Counts.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>All the women now withdrew save the Electress's lady,
Sophia von Miltitz, and R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a corner, before a table, stood one Wolf Sesdel, a
notary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince of Orange had changed his attire; he was
in rose cloth of gold from head to foot, with a short cloak
of dark violet velvet lined with blue, and a triple ruff of
gold tissue.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e glanced at him again. "A mere courtier, like his
brother," she thought. Her eyes turned to Count John;
he, too, was a princely young man, though without the
great charm of William or the infinite grace of Louis.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bride and groom were now placed opposite each other
before the notary, his brother and one of his gentlemen
behind the Prince; Dame Sophia, one of the councillors,
and R√©n√®e, behind Anne; in front Elector and Electress
with Hans von Ponika, the second councillor, who addressed
the Prince, reminding him that the Elector had sent him
a memorandum requiring him to preserve Anne in her
present faith, to allow her to receive the Augsburg sacraments,
even, at extreme need, in her chamber, and to
instruct her children in the doctrines of the Reformed
Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>This memorandum William had always refused to sign.
He listened to the councillor's long speech courteously,
but with a look of amusement, R√©n√®e thought, as if he
appreciated at its true value this last attempt on the part
of Augustus to salve his conscience on the question of the
bridegroom's Papistry.</p>

<p class='c000'>"As your princely Highness," continued Von Ponika,
"has been pleased to so far give no agreement in writing
on these points, it has been arranged that you should now
give your consent verbally, before these princely witnesses."</p>

<p class='c000'>William, with laughing eyes in a grave face, looked at
the Elector, whose stern features were impassive. Anne
was trembling like one in a fever, and continually pressing
her handkerchief to her dry lips and burning cheeks.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Von Ponika proceeded to read the memorandum which
William had rejected since April last, and asked if His
Highness was prepared to keep the articles contained
therein?</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince advanced a step towards the Elector and
answered‚ÄîR√©n√®e noted his voice, low, deep, and soft,
a very masculine voice‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gracious Elector, I remember the writing that you
sent me in April, and which this learned doctor has just
read. I now declare to Your Highness that I will act in all
as becomes a Prince, and conform to this note as I ever
said I would conform."</p>

<p class='c000'>This evasion was all the Elector had hoped for. He
knew as well as William did that no subject of King Philip
could live according to the Augsburg Confession nor
practise the rites of the Reformed Church, but he had
finally satisfied his conscience, and when William offered
his hand the Elector took it heartily.</p>

<p class='c000'>The notary then put the Prince's reply on record, and
all left the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bridal procession was now formed. In front the
Court musicians playing bravely, after them the marshals,
the nobles, the guests, the envoys, the Elector and his wife,
and the bride and groom, followed by the councillors and
such of the Netherland grandees who had dared King
Philip sufficiently to attend a wedding His Majesty secretly
frowned on.</p>

<p class='c000'>So to the sound of drums and trumpet they entered the
great hall, which was hung from ceiling to floor with fine
silk tapestries of Arras and carpeted with Eastern rugs,
and furnished with five round tables and chairs, each chair
like a throne.</p>

<p class='c000'>There the marriage ceremony took place. If the Elector
had tacitly accepted William's evasions on religious questions,
William as tacitly accepted the Lutheran marriage
rites, which would have been little to the taste of King
Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>After Doctor Pfeffinger had united the two, Anne was
conducted to a gold couch with gold curtains set on a dais
at the upper end of the hall; the Prince seated himself
beside her, and kneeling pages of noble blood handed them
goblets of rock crystal filled with sweet wine, and comfits
on plates of engraved silver.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rest of the company were also served, and all drank
standing and looking towards the bride. Anne's spirits had
now risen; she was flushed with pride and happiness,
her eyes sparkled, and she drank her wine with a relish.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince had rather an absent look, though completely
at his ease; his mind did not appear to be wholly
in the ceremonies in which he was taking part so gracefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>He now rose, and the Margrave of Brandenburg raised
Anne and presented her to her husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Gracious Highness," he said, "I give you this
maiden on behalf of the Elector, and I recommend Your
Grace to cherish her with all care and affection, and to
leave her undisturbed in the right use of the Holy Gospel
and Sacraments."</p>

<p class='c000'>The bridal couple parted, to a second time change their
garments.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne was in a rapture.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is he not noble and fine?" she asked her weary
women as they again disrobed her. "I think there is no
knight like him in Europe. And how foolish my uncle is
with his notes and promises! As if I could not trust my
princely husband!"</p>

<p class='c000'>She used the new title with an affected laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am now the Princess of Orange," she added.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, Highness," said R√©n√®e. She was weary from the
long hours of standing; her head ached from the noise of
the drums and trumpets, the glare of all the mingled gems
and flashing gold and the bright colours of the dresses,
the intensity of the heat, and lack of food. None of the
overworked women had eaten since morning; the kitchens
were wholly absorbed in preparations for the wedding feast.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Anne's shrill, excited chatter fell distastefully on the
ears of R√©n√®e. 'What will they think of her in Brussels?'
she wondered; it seemed grotesque to imagine her the
head of the Prince of Orange's gorgeous and extravagant
household, the greatest lady in the brilliant Court of the
Regent.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Anne, at least, seemed not to doubt at all of coming
triumphs; as she was arrayed she talked incessantly of her
future glories.</p>

<p class='c000'>She now wore a gown of blue satin with an overskirt of
silver brocade worked with raised yellow roses, her bodice
was one stiff piece of silver as if she was encased in the
precious metal itself, her long yellow sleeves were caught
together and fastened with sapphire studs; her bosom was
bare, but round her throat was a fine ruff reaching to her
ears and sparkling with little brilliants, her hair was confined
under a cap of silver tissue, and from her shoulders
hung a mantle of darker yellow satin with a great collar
of rose velvet and a lining of blue.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus she returned to the great hall where covers for
fifty were laid, ten at each table, and the first course of
twenty-five dishes being immediately served, she took her
place beside her husband, who wore crimson satin cut over
violet cloth of gold, and so sewn with gold that no more
than a gleam of the stuff was visible. The Elector's choir
began to play a gay measure, and twelve young counts with
gold wreaths on their heads brought forward the wine,
the water, the napkins for the use of the bride and groom.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now past six, and the great heat diminishing.
R√©n√®e and the other women went slowly about the Princess's
apartments, putting straight the disorder, and beginning to
lay by the gowns in the long travelling coffers; the sound
of the bridal music came faintly to their ears, and faintly
they could savour the mingled odours of the extravagant
wedding dishes. As they moved about their task they
ate cakes and comfits, having little hope of a supper that
night, and in a tired, disjointed way they talked together.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>"She is quite right, he is very handsome," said one,
"and very magnificent too. They say he is greatly in
debt."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, there will not be much of her fortune left to
repair holes in his," replied another. "Such extravagance!
And she looks all the uglier for it all. And I hear
he is fond of pretty women." The speaker glanced with
some satisfaction at her own pleasing reflection in Anne's
mirror.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Was his first wife well favoured?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, she was straight and had a quiet tongue."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Herr Jesus! Why should he wed Fr√§ulein Anne?"
cried another damsel, wearily seating herself. "Not for
her beauty, nor her money‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"For their 'reasons of State,'" quoted R√©n√®e, "and
also because he does not know her. This will prove an ugly
marriage. He does not look a man to suffer a curst wife."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps she will be sweeter now," replied the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is no sweetness in her," said a third, gathering
up the bunches of lavender, allspice leaves, rosemary, and
orris-root that were to be laid among the bride's clothes
in the long carved caskets.</p>

<p class='c000'>"How my head aches!" said R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is her voice," replied one of the women, "it rings
in the head like the clanging of a brass bell. Come and
see the dancing. We can leave this work for a while."</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e and three of her companions slipped away and
went by the back entrances to the gallery overlooking
the Grand Hall; the soldiers allowed them to pass, and
the pages brought them sugar sticks, fruit, and comfits
left from the feast.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am sickened with sweets to-day," said R√©n√®e, with a
faint smile. She rested her elbows on the carved balustrade
of the gallery and looked down.</p>

<p class='c000'>The tables had been removed and the hall cleared for
dancing; the summer sun still shone without, but had
left the high windows, and already lamps, hanging to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>ceiling bosses by gold chains, were lit, sending a soft
light over the polished floor and silk hangings on the wall;
the choir was singing and playing, and the Court and guests
were moving through one of the elaborate figures of the prearranged
dances. The ladies in their great farthingales,
stiff bodices, and long trains, the gentlemen in their huge
ruffs, formal cloaks, embroidered doublets, and gleaming
chains, moved slowly and precisely through the intricacies
of the dance, as if they traced some complicated pattern on
the floor with their fine and sparkling shoes.</p>

<p class='c000'>To R√©n√®e they seemed as if they were being moved by
invisible strings from the dark ceiling‚Äîso many puppets
moving with stiff grace and immobile dignity.</p>

<p class='c000'>She sought out the rose red and gold figure of the Prince
of Orange; he was dancing with the Electress. She
noticed that he moved with more spirit and gaiety than any
of the others; also that he kept bad time to the music,
and more than once was a little out of step in the long
galliard he had not previously rehearsed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dance at an end the bride and groom returned to
their gold couch, and a band of maidens in green and purple
entered the hall and presented them with long sheaves of
lilies bound with silver cords, round bunches of crimson
and white roses, sprays of myrtle blossom, and parcels of
sweets in gold tissue.</p>

<p class='c000'>After this the Chamberlain clapped his hands and a
party of masquers ran in, curiously habited as Turks,
Russians, fools, bird-snarers, and giants, and began executing
a fantastic measure.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Prince brought them from the Netherlands,"
said one of the waiting-women.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is a silly show," replied R√©n√®e, "or else I have no
heart for these things."</p>

<p class='c000'>She left the gallery and returned to Anne's temporary
apartments, which would no longer be used, as others had
been prepared for the Prince and Princess. R√©n√®e mechanically
sorted and folded the confusion of garments, locked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>away the hastily discarded jewels, arranged the brushes,
combs, unguents, crimping irons, curling sticks, powders,
perfumes, that had been used in the adornment of the bride,
then opened the curtains and stepped out of the narrow
window on to the little curved balcony that overlooked the
market square.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pale purple sky spread, stainless of cloud, above the
roofs, gables, and towers; the bells were ringing gay peals
from all the chiming belfries of Leipsic; joy-fires flared up
here and there against the crystal light of the stars; the
breeze was perfumed with the scent of summer and still
sun-warmed. R√©n√®e was not thinking of the gaiety and
loveliness of the festival night; through her mind ran a
few sentences she had overheard from two Netherlanders
of the Prince's suite as she went up the back staircase to
see the dancing.</p>

<p class='c000'>"How long will these feasts last?" one had said. "The
Cardinal plays his own game at home‚Äîit would be well
to return immediately."</p>

<p class='c000'>"They say he will persuade the King to enforce the
Inquisition," the other answered, "so resolute is he to
extirpate heresy."</p>

<p class='c000'>And the two men had looked stern, gloomy, and anxious
for guests at a bridal feast, and R√©n√®e recalled their words
with a bitter shudder.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the Inquisition that had arrested her father and
handed him over to his death; it was the Inquisition that
had confiscated his entire property and left her mother and
herself dependent on charity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her face grew hard and almost fierce.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Extirpate heresy," she said half aloud. "Well, I will
die that way too."</p>

<p class='c000'>The joy-fires sprang up and the bells and the music
blended; presently the stars faded in the light of the risen
moon.</p>

<p class='c000'>St. Batholomew's Day was over and the famous marriage
accomplished at last.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V<br /> WILLIAM OF ORANGE</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>The morrow of the wedding, in the still early hours
before the tourneys, mummings, and festivals had
begun, while Anne was in the hands of women
again being combed, perfumed, and arrayed for the gaieties
of the day, the Prince left the town hall unattended and
crossed the market square to the handsome residence
where his brothers were lodged. Count Louis and Count
Adolphus were still abed, weary with dancing and feasting,
but Count John was in the great library of the house
writing letters. This Nassau was a fine member of his fine
race, well-made, alert, with intelligent noble features,
though blunter than those of his brothers and too broad
for perfect comeliness; his eyes were dark and unusually
brilliant, his close hair and moustaches light brown; he
had not the great courtliness and magnificence of William
nor the singular charm of his younger brother, but he was
a very frank, open, high-minded gentleman of a winning
appearance, though somewhat grave for his twenty-five
years.</p>

<p class='c000'>He still wore his morning gown of purple velvet with
great sleeves purflewed in gold; like all his house he was
eminently a grand seigneur.</p>

<p class='c000'>When his brother entered he rose and greeted him with
real affection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although William had so early left his home for a new
faith and more splendid fortunes, which had made him
an intimate of an Emperor and placed him high above all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>his family in rank, his relations with his parents and his
brothers and sisters had always remained warm and
sincere. The recent death of his father had left him Count
of Nassau and head of the Dillenburg branch of his house,
and his brothers regarded him with augmented devotion
and affection both as their hereditary chief and the most
famous and brilliant wearer of their name.</p>

<p class='c000'>"So early?" said Count John.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I had news from Mechlin last night," said William,
who had his agents everywhere. "Did you hear?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay," replied his brother. "How should I hear
anything yesterday save jests and compliments? How
is little Anne?"</p>

<p class='c000'>William raised his brows and smiled; he moved to the
sunny window, and seated himself in the red-cushioned
embrasure. John, with a quick excuse, returned to finish
his letter which was to his mother at Dillenburg, giving
her an account of yesterday's ceremony.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince looked out on to the market square; the
long tension of his marriage negotiations being now over,
he felt a kind of disappointment mingled with his relief,
almost as if in his heart he doubted if this much-disputed
match had been worth the immense pains he had taken to
forward it. Hitherto his relations with women had always
been pleasant; he had been first married, when he was
seventeen, to Anne of Egmont, the wealthy heiress of the
Van Burens. Her hand had not been sought by him, but
had been in the nature of a magnificent gift from the favour
of the Emperor. Anne, however, had been gentle, prudent,
tender, and he had lived with her in contentment and
peace; the other women whom he had known or courted
since her death had all had some quality to attract or
enthral. He was a knight who could choose among the
finest by reason of his person as well as of his rank, and
his taste had always led him to the gay, the magnificent,
the loving. The few hours since he had met his bride
yesterday had seemed to show him a specimen of womanhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>with which he was unfamiliar; the fretful, deformed,
passionate, and ignorant girl who was now his wife a little
bewildered, a little troubled him. Already he had been
stung by her tactless exhibition of the pride that could rate
him her inferior, already he had winced a little at the
unattractiveness her hysteric excitement and her over-sumptuous
attire had emphasized.</p>

<p class='c000'>Count John closed up and sealed his letter, then glanced
at William, who still sat thoughtfully; the sun was over
him from head to foot, and sparkled in the thick waves of
his chestnut hair and in the bronze and gold threads of
the dark-green damask doublet he wore.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What news from Mechlin?" asked the younger
brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Granvelle made a public entry to celebrate his appointment
as archbishop," replied William briefly. "No one
of consequence was there, and the people went into their
houses and put the shutters up."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is believed that he will enforce the Inquisition in
the Netherlands," remarked John thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He most assuredly will," said William. "He seems
to have unbounded influence with the King."</p>

<p class='c000'>John looked at him and hesitated; he saw that his
brother was unusually grave, and he had a shrewd guess
at the cause, but he did not venture to probe William's
unusual reserve.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What did you come to speak of?" he ventured at
last.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of Cardinal Granvelle," answered William, looking
at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Count John cast down his brilliant eyes. He was a keen
follower of the political events in the Netherlands, and
knew perfectly well how matters stood between Cardinal
Granvelle and his brother; it was a difficult position, and
one that promised great storms in the future.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anthony Perrenot, at first Bishop of Arras, recently
created Archbishop of Mechlin and Cardinal Granvelle, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>at one time been an intimate and supporter of William of
Orange, and was still by the world considered his friend;
his brother had been William's tutor, and numbers of his
relatives held posts and offices in William's lavish and
magnificent household. The Prince as Stadtholder of
Holland, Utrecht, and Zeeland, and member of the State
Council, and the priest as the most powerful member of all
the three Boards which advised and controlled Margaret of
Parma‚ÄîPhilip's recently-appointed Regent in the Netherlands‚Äîhad
been much brought together, and at first had
works as colleagues and friends. But lately Granvelle's
violence toward heresy, his smiling insolence, his rapacity,
his underhand intrigues with Philip had alienated him
from William, who was averse to persecution, and, moreover,
since their last stormy parting in the streets of
Flushing, no longer in such high favour with his master,
Philip. The friendship between Granvelle and William
had changed to coolness, then to dislike, and would soon, it
seemed, approach open rupture; the priest's new dignities,
which set him above all Margaret's councillors‚Äîwho had
always regarded him as their inferior (he was the son of
a Burgundian commoner)‚Äîdid not please the Prince, and
this triumphal entry into Mechlin during his absence was
a piece of defiance on the part of the new Cardinal that
further irritated him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This Perrenot grows too great," he said now impulsively.
"He has the ear of the Regent‚Äî‚Äî" He checked
himself, looked at his brother, who was watching him
eagerly, and then added, "John, what do you think
would happen if the Inquisition were set up in the Netherlands
as it is in Spain?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The States General, the Councils, the Stadtholders
would protest."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And if their protests were of no avail?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then‚ÄîI do not know," said John gravely.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The people would revolt," replied William of Orange,
"for I tell you nearly all in the Netherlands are at heart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>of the Reformed Faith. When His Majesty delivered to
me my charge, he counselled me to stamp out heresy, and
he gave me several papers containing lists of those suspected‚Äîthere
were many hundreds of them. Some great
ones I warned. And I burned the lists. But Cardinal
Granvelle has already ferreted out many whose names were
thereon."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I did not know of this," exclaimed John.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Lock it in your heart," said the Prince. "I was bred
a heretic," he added, with a smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have always seemed one of us to me," returned
the brother simply, "and never a true Papist."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, I am a good Catholic," said William, looking out
of the window, "but I do not think any man should lose
his life for his faith, nay, nor his property nor his honours.
I believe in tolerance, John, and there are few of that mind."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It would be a monstrous thing if you should become
a persecutor," said Count John, "seeing our father was
the first Prince to bring the Reformed Faith into Germany."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Had I been of that inclination," replied the Prince,
"I should not have made this match. What do you think
was the reason of it, if not the alliance of Saxony and
Cassel‚Äîthese Protestant States?" He rose now and,
looking very earnestly at his brother, came forward into
the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>"John," he said, narrowing his eyes a little, "it is in
my heart to tell you of something I have as yet told no
man. And do you keep it secret, even from our brothers,
who are as yet very young."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Speak what you wish; it stays with me," replied
Count John.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is this then: When I and the Duke of Alva were
hostages in France, there was an occasion when I was
with King Henry hunting‚Äîin the forest of Vincennes
it was‚Äîand we two being apart from the others, the
King fell to talking of the peace between him and King
Philip, and his great eagerness for the concluding of this.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Then, drawing on in his discourse, he did disclose to me a
deep design there was between him and my King to exterminate
heretics‚Äîwhich design the Duke of Alva was
privy to and arranging with him, and he thought I too
knew of it, so discussed it with me. And it seemed that
this secret project was no less than to destroy all heretics
in the realms of France and Spain, and to so uproot the
doctrines of Luther that they would never grow again.
And this, he said, might be partly done by a general
slaughter of these heretics, but the time was not yet ripe.
And from his speech I understood that if one looked but
askance at an image he might be cast into the flames."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And you‚Äîwhat did you do?" asked John, startled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I feigned that I knew as he thought I did, marked and
noted what he said, and breathed no word of it," replied
the Prince simply, as if such self-control and astuteness
were the commonest things.</p>

<p class='c000'>Count John was silent with astonishment and interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And therefore, as you remember," continued William,
"as soon as I was returned I did influence the States
General to beg the King to send forth the foreign soldiery,
which he could not well refuse."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, it was you, not the States!" exclaimed John.</p>

<p class='c000'>"As His Majesty guessed," smiled William. "'Not
the States, but you‚Äîyou!' he said,‚Äîin the second person,
John. That was in a Flushing street, and I left him there
and would not see him to his ship."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But since then he has been as favourable to you as
always," said Count John anxiously, "even in the matter of
this marriage, which was hateful to him, he gave in and
sent you a gift."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yet," replied the Prince, "he would put me and the
other Stadtholders beneath the foot of Granvelle, who is,
I do not doubt, his chosen instrument to commence this
work of exterminating heresy in the States."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I was much dismayed when first I heard from King
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Henry of this ruthless policy, for I knew it meant the
ruin and death of many virtuous people; and then I
resolved I would do what I could for them, especially in
the Netherlands. And so I will."</p>

<p class='c000'>Count John looked slightly surprised to hear his magnificent
brother speak with such unwonted gravity.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, who is to withstand King Philip and King
Philip's men‚Äîsuch as Granvelle?" he asked rather
hopelessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The House of Nassau might do it," smiled William
lightly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You do not mean to oppose the King?" cried the
Count.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, God forbid," said the Prince, in the same tone,
"but I might oppose his policies, and I shall certainly
put a stone or so in the path of my Lord Cardinal."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I fear this marriage has done you little good after
all," remarked his brother regretfully. "Here is the
King and the Regent displeased, and the Landgrave of
Cassel angered too. Apart from your religion, he says
(his son told me), you have too many debts to take a wife."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Those same debts must be looked to," said William,
in the assurance of a man of unlimited wealth and unassailable
position.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And the story has got abroad," continued the Count
ruefully, "of that banquet you gave with the cloth
and plates and dishes all of sugar, and the Landgrave is
spreading it round Saxony and Cassel as a proof of your
great extravagance."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And what of these festivities?" laughed William.
"Will they not cost every thaler of the Fr√§ulein's dower
that has been so much vaunted?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Count John sighed. The Nassau family had largely
built up their present position through prudent and
splendid marriages, and he was sorry that his brother,
who had married the richest heiress in the Netherlands
for his first wife, should not have done more magnificently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>with his second choice, for he saw nothing to recommend
Anne but her rank, her father's fame, and the possible
alliance of her Protestant kinsfolk‚Äîall, Count John
thought, doubtful benefit.</p>

<p class='c000'>William came up to his brother and placed his shapely
hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>"These debts will be looked to," he repeated. "Wait
till I return to Brussels."</p>

<p class='c000'>The door opened hastily, and Louis and Adolphus
entered, both in their light tourney harness, and laughing
together from sheer gaiety and amusement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adolphus was equipped from head to foot in a crimson
padded jousting suit studded with gilt metal nails; he
was the youngest of the four, no more than a youth, noble
in appearance, and wholly lovable, fairer than his brother
in colouring, but of the same slenderness of make.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both greeted William with great affection, and Louis,
who was clattering in gold-embossed cuirass, cuisses,
vambraces, and greaves, broke out laughing with the jest
that had so diverted him and Adolphus.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Highness, we want the old magician to foretell the
future for us‚Äîhe has a spirit who can reveal all things;
he said he would call it if we wished, and ask what our fate
would be!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Tush!" said John hastily, "belike it were mummery
or else a trick of the Devil."</p>

<p class='c000'>But William was always ready for curious trials and
experiments, though he had strangely little belief in any
such things.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who is this magician?" he asked gaily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A Frenchman who has his abode with the Elector's
alchemist," replied Adolphus. "They say he has done
wonderful things. The Elector declares he really has
such a spirit."</p>

<p class='c000'>"His Grace is very credulous," remarked Louis. "He
will take no action but after he has consulted his charts
and his tables, his wheels of fortune and his crystals."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>"I believe," persisted John, "that the Devil is in it all."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well," declared Adolphus, "the man is coming here
to-night before supper, when we shall have a little leisure."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I will come if I may," said the Prince. "Perhaps I
shall have time while Anne is with her tire-women."</p>

<p class='c000'>He took up his hat and prepared to leave; he saw that
there was no chance of a further private talk with John,
and he was too much of a courtier to risk being late in
his return to the town hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he passed Louis and Adolphus, he put them back
against the wall and laughingly criticized their appointments,
while John came and leant on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>The four brothers, all so young, so charming, so magnificent,
so full of noble life and vigour, made a fair picture
as they stood so, laughing together from sheer good spirits
because this was the lovely morning of their days and
none of them had yet known sorrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>In their slender knightly persons, the very erect carriage
of their small heads, their warm colouring, something
quick and fiery in their movements, there showed a great
likeness between them, proclaiming their common blood,
but each was a distinct personality‚Äîthe Prince, dark,
dominant, superb, despite his gay smiling air; John,
serious, slightly austere; Louis, graceful, charming, modest,
with his long light-brown locks and laughing eyes; Adolphus,
blonde, handsome, eager, very princely in bearing.</p>

<p class='c000'>So, still laughing, they parted, William hastening
across the sunny square, where every cap was lifted and
every head bent to him, to the town hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he approached the antechamber to his apartments,
he saw Anne through an open door.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was ready clothed for the midday repast and the
tourney in a gown of violet cloth of gold veiled in falls
of silver lace and finished by a ruff of pure gold thread a
foot deep.</p>

<p class='c000'>William heard her sharp voice raised, and instinctively
slackened his step.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>A lock of Anne's tresses had caught in the stiff edge of
her ruff; one of her women in disengaging it chanced to
pull the crimped hair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne turned and smacked the girl's face smartly enough
to bring the tears to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince saw this little episode; a new type she was
indeed, this fierce little cat with her claws always ready,
he thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he entered the room Anne became all softness and
affection and gentleness.</p>

<p class='c000'>William saluted her rather absently, but she flushed
with joy at his conventional courtly compliments which
her inexperience took literally.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Tell me of Brussels?" she implored, clinging to his
arm. "What shall I do in Brussels?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Amuse yourself, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ma mie</span></i>," replied William lightly,
"and learn the courtesies of the country," he added with
a gentle sarcasm which was wholly unperceived by the
bride.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>When Dupr√®s, the alchemist's crystal gazer and
spirit raiser, heard that he was commanded to
the lodging of the young Counts of Nassau with
the object of foretelling their future, he gave one of his
usual whimsical smiles, as if he despised the credulity and
curiosity of those who sought him, and proceeded to pack
up his magic table.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vanderlinden, who had found his colleague's spirits
more tantalizing and vexing than helpful, tried to dissuade
him from putting his powers to the proof before
such reckless young cavaliers "who have no respect nor
taste for holy things," he said, "and mean but to mock
and jest at the spirits."</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Frenchman was a mysterious creature given to
whims and impulses and secretive ways, and wholly beyond
the control of the alchemist who kept him for his undoubted
gifts, but found him the most trying of companions
and allies.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this occasion he made no answer to his master's
protests, but continued his preparations.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is Count Adolphus," complained Vanderlinden.
"All the while Count Louis was at Dresden he showed
no wish to consult the spirits."</p>

<p class='c000'>This was quite true. Louis of Nassau had no turn for
the mystical, and the scant leisure allowed him by his
brother's marriage negotiations had been employed in
more full-blooded amusement than that of spirit raising.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>His eagerness for reckless adventure had, however, caused
him to at once accede to his brother's suggestion that
they should put to the test the powers of the Elector's
magician (as they called him).</p>

<p class='c000'>"I hear the Prince of Orange will be present also," said
Vanderlinden, vexed, "and he is a great person and
not one to be lightly brought into affairs of this kind."</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s gave no answer; his strange, dry, and rather
impudent face was wrinkled with a smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, you do it without my sanction," remarked
Vanderlinden, who knew he could not control his unruly
assistant, and, drawing his robes about him, he retired to
his turret.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before he set out for the Counts' house, Dupr√®s, after
his wont, looked up the careers of the personages who had
called upon him in a great notebook which was always
with him, and in which he had gathered details of all the
notable people of Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of three of the brothers there was little to be said;
they were too young to have had any career, and were
merely great nobles, born and bred in the Reformed Faith,
all unmarried, and residing in the ancestral castle at Dillenburg
together with the youngest brother, Henry, and seven
sisters, of whom one, Catherine, had recently married the
Count of Schwartzenburg, who had been Louis's joint envoy
at Dresden.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis himself had lived largely at Brussels under the
protection of his brother, and in an official position (despite
his faith) under Philip's government.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was all there was to be said of these three, but
William of Orange occupied a conspicuous and unique
position, and had already had a career of exceptional
brilliance.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was much about him in Dupr√®s' notebooks.</p>

<p class='c000'>He seemed indeed Fortune's favourite.</p>

<p class='c000'>Through the Nassaus he came of a family that was one
of the most illustrious in Europe. One of their members
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>had worn the Imperial crown; others, as Dukes of Guelders,
had been sovereigns in the Netherlands hundreds of years
before the House of Burgundy, to whom Philip owed his
throne, had ruled there; Engelbert of Nassau had been one
of the councillors of Charles the Bold; his eldest son had
been the confidential friend of the great Emperor Charles
V, and had largely helped to place the Imperial crown on the
head of his master.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had further increased the splendour of his house by a
marriage with Claude de Chalons, heiress of her brother,
Philibert, Prince of Orange; his son, Ren√© de Nassau
Chalons, succeeded to the united possessions of Nassau and
Orange, and, dying young and childless in the Emperor's
arms at the battle of St. Dizier, bequeathed all these
honours to his boy cousin William, the present Prince,
and eldest son of Count William, younger brother of Ren√©'s
father Henry, head of the branch of Nassau Dillenburg
and of Juliana of Stolberg, his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>The price of Charles's consent to Ren√©'s will was that
the young heir to such power should be brought up a
Papist under his own eyes, and to this, his father, though
now a Protestant, had, in the interests of his son, consented,
and the young Lutheran, at the age of eleven, was sent to
the Imperial Court to be educated and trained.</p>

<p class='c000'>He soon enjoyed a remarkable degree of favour with the
Emperor, and at the age of seventeen was given the hand
of Anne, daughter of Maximilian van Buren and the
richest heiress in the Netherlands, soon afterwards being
appointed, over the heads of many tried and splendid
soldiers, commander-in-chief of the Imperial forces on the
frontier‚Äîa post that he filled to the Emperor's satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had been further distinguished by being the support
of Charles on the occasion of that monarch's flamboyant
public abdication, and by having been deputed to carry
the Imperial Insignia to the new Emperor, Ferdinand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Immediately on the accession of Philip he had been
employed by him to negotiate the peace with France,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>which was soon after signed, and which he had conducted
in a manner highly satisfactory to Spain, leaving the
King considerably in his debt, for the peace was a triumphant
one for Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince had been selected (with the Duke of Alva)
as one of the hostages given by Spain to France, and,
immediately on his return from Paris, had strenuously
supported the States in their demand for the removal of
Spanish troops from the Netherlands, thereby putting
himself in sudden and unexpected opposition to Philip,
from whom, on that King's departure from the Netherlands,
he had parted with considerable coolness.</p>

<p class='c000'>He retained, however, the Stadtholdership of three
important provinces, and remained a member of the State
Council who advised the Regent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lately, the Saxon marriage was supposed to have embittered
his already strained relations with the King, who
had, however, recently given his consent to the match, and
even sent a sum of money to the Regent to buy a ring for
the bride. He was believed to be estranged from the
arbitrary and stern measures of the new Cardinal, and to
favour the ancient liberties of the Netherlands and tolerance
for the heretics.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the rest he was the most magnificent grandee in the
Low Countries, his splendid hospitality was famous,
his table renowned in Europe, his cooks coveted by Philip‚Äîwho
was a greater glutton than any man in his own kingdoms‚Äîhis
debts were supposed to be huge, but there was
never any stint in the lavish extravagance with which he
kept up his princely residences, and his fortune, together
with that left him by his first wife, was known to be
enormous; his revenues were but one-third less than those
the King drew from the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Prince of Orange, he was a sovereign ruler, owing
allegiance to no one; his other titles were perhaps more
numerous than those any noble in Europe could boast.</p>

<p class='c000'>As his father's heir, he was Count of Nassau and head of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>the Dillenburg branch of that ancient house; he was also
Count of Catzenellenbogen, Count of Brabant, Marquis of
Ter Veere, Viscount of Antwerp; as heir to the Orange,
Beaux, and Chalons families, he claimed the kingdom of
Arles, the dukedom of Gramine, three principalities,
two margraveships, two viscountships, sixteen countships,
more than fifty baronies, and three hundred lordships,
and though most of these French titles were but shadowy
honours, he drew a princely revenue from his estates in
Franche-Comte, and his claim to the lands in Dauphine
had been admitted. He also owned estates in Brabant,
Luxembourg, and Flanders, and all the property of the Van
Burens which his first wife had been able to leave him.
He was a knight of the Golden Fleece‚Äîthat sumptuous
and princely order‚Äîa Grandee of Spain, Stadtholder of
three provinces, a member of Margaret's Council, and had
been, until their withdrawal, commander, with Lamoral
Egmont, Prince of Gravern, of all the Spanish troops in
the Netherlands, as he had been commander-in-chief
during the late war with France.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such was the outward history of this Prince, who,
though still in his first youth, was already so unusually
distinguished both by his fortunes, his position, his magnificence,
his charm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"One of the great ones of the earth," remarked Dupr√®s,
carefully locking away the notebook after having committed
to memory the leading points in William's career.
The spirits did not always prove tractable, and when they
were dumb Dupr√®s was always ready to satisfy the inquirer
with a few judiciously vague replies of his own
composition. He indeed cheated so often, so shamelessly,
and so skilfully that Vanderlinden had lately lost all faith
in him, and for this reason alone had been reluctant that
Dupr√®s should experiment before the young Princes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The alchemist, whose position under the Elector was his
sole revenue, was in constant fear of losing it through
some trick or freakish jest on the part of his assistant.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>He made, however, no further attempt to interfere
(knowing well enough that it was hopeless), and towards
the appointed hour Dupr√®s, with the two apprentices‚Äîsour
at having been summoned early from the tourney‚Äîbehind
him carrying the magic table, went forth into
the sunny dusty streets filled with merry idle crowds
in their best clothes, most of whom were discussing the
prowess of the Elector at the jousts, His Grace having held
the field against all comers, and shivered the spears of many
a famous knight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reaching the Counts' lodging Dupr√®s dismissed the two
young men, and himself proceeded to unpack his table.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cavaliers had not yet returned from the tourney,
but Dupr√®s was served very civilly with wine and comfits.</p>

<p class='c000'>The room into which he had been admitted was a fairly
small cabinet, panelled in dark oak, and looking on the
garden. It could be lit by a lamp depending by a copper
chain from the centre of the ceiling; there was neither
fireplace nor candle sconces. The furniture was composed
merely of a few black chairs, a table, and an armoir.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spirit raiser declared himself satisfied with this
chamber as the right setting for his experiment, as he
modestly called it, but he desired the servants to remove
the armoir, less he should be accused of having an accomplice
within (it was large enough to hold a man), and also
the table, as he wished to set up his own in place of it.
When this was done he asked them to take away all the
chairs but five, one for himself and the others for the four
princes. He also requested that the shutters should be
closed, the lamp lit, and silence kept without during the
experience, lest some unusual noise should fright or vex the
spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'>His preparations being now complete, he set himself to
nicely adjust the magic table in the interval of waiting.</p>

<p class='c000'>This table was a curious and precious object, and Dupr√®s
had carried it with him through many adventures and over
the greater part of Europe. It was of sweet wood, three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>feet high, and set on four legs, each of which was set on a
seal of pure wax engraved with a mystical sign and the
seven names of God, the whole put on a thick square of red
and gold changeable silk; in the centre of the table was
another of the seals, larger and more deeply imprinted,
and over this was a red silk cover with knots of gold at
the four corners; in the centre of this cloth was a large
crystal ball, egg-shaped, and of a most special brightness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s now wrote certain characters with sacred oil
on the legs of the table, and all was complete. The spirit
raiser‚Äîor skryer, as he had been called in England‚Äîwas
himself attired in a plain black coat and breeches with
velvet half-socks of a purple colour, a plain band and a
black skull cap, an attire which he affected to give him an
air of greater gravity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after the appointed hour, laughter, the jingle
of spurs, the clink of armour sounded without, and the
young Counts impetuously entered the apartment.</p>

<p class='c000'>William of Orange, to Dupr√®s' secret satisfaction, was
with his brothers, but Count John was missing; in his
place was a youth still in dusty armour with a face fresh
as a rose. Dupr√®s knew him for Duke Christopher, son
of the Elector Palatine, and as this substitution upset his
calculations he demanded why Count John had not come?</p>

<p class='c000'>"He was afraid of the Devil, Dominus," replied the
young Duke, as they all seated themselves, laughing, on the
five chairs placed in a row ready for them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"As to that," replied Dupr√®s coldly, "I would have
Your Grace know that I keep no such company. I associate
with neither imps nor hell-hounds, being no conjurer nor
magician, as the vulgar may suppose, but a good mathematician,
alchemist, and astrologer, which are noble sciences
and have accomplished great marvels, as, notably, the
brazen head of Albertus Magnus‚Äîwhich could speak‚Äîthe
sphere of Archimedes, the dove of Archytas, and the wheel
of Vulcan. And for myself I have seen clay birds that
fly and iron insects that crawl."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>With that he seated himself before the magic table, and
the young Princes, who had but a little while to spare
before the evening festivities called them, besought him
to hasten.</p>

<p class='c000'>The skryer looked at them over the crystal ball; they
were pleasant to see in their youth, their splendour, their
comeliness and gaiety, as princely and as fair a company
as could well be brought together.</p>

<p class='c000'>All were in their light armour with silk scarves and
jewelled chains and ladies' favours tied to their arms, save
only William, who wore a suit of green cloth of gold with
pearl embroidery on the sleeves, a scarf of violet, and a
mantle of black velvet. He leaned forward, his elbow on
his knee, his dark face in his fine hand, looking at the
skryer; at his breast was a cluster of roses, and their perfume
filled the small chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, ye great ones," thought Dupr√®s, "what is before
you but idleness, luxury, and pomp? Wherefore should
ye seek to know the future‚Äîyour ways are very clear set
before you."</p>

<p class='c000'>He asked one to lower the lamp, and Adolphus rose and
pulled the string; a dim, but clear, light now filled the
chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I would have you notice, princely seigneurs," said
Dupr√®s, "that I am not in communication with any but
good angels; from the seven names of God proceed seven
angels, and from each letter of their names proceed seven
more angels‚Äîfrom the male letters, male angels; from the
female letters, female angels. And they are unable to speak
anything but the truth, coming as they do from God's footstool.
They are to be regarded with awe, humility, and
reverence. Which of them will come, I know not, but
whoever it be, I beseech your friendly Graces to observe
a decent silence and a discreet behaviour."</p>

<p class='c000'>He then set his elbows on the table, clasped his hands
about his brow, and gazed into the crystal. At first he
beheld nothing but the gold curtain which usually at first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>concealed the spirit world from his view, and this remained
for a while until he was beginning to fear that the spirits
would not come to-day, and that to satisfy these young men
he must resort to trickery, which was dangerous, difficult,
and fatiguing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently, however, the gold curtain was caught together
and hurled into the centre of the globe which
changed to a luminous colour, like amber with a light
behind it, and began to throb and pulse with radiance, so
that Dupr√®s looked into an immense distance of pure gold
like the strongest sunshine, troubled by changing, moving
forms which seemed to turn together, mingle, and then
again separate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The globe itself gave forth a strong glow, which illuminated
the head and face of the skryer as if he sat in front of
a lamp, and rendered pale by contrast the light hanging
above him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adolphus pointed out this mysterious light to the others,
and they leant forward in a tense silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I see," said Dupr√®s, "two of the spirits, Volvangel
and Kendrick‚Äîthey are walking together hand in hand."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is their appearance?" asked Duke Christopher.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Volvangel wears a black suit of tabinet," replied the
skryer, "a little sword, and his hair falling down long,
also slippers of a red colour; the other angel is more fantastical
and has a doublet of white satin cut into points
below the belt, and yellow hose."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Methinks they lack dignity," said Count Louis, who
had expected something more strange and awe-inspiring;
"surely these are bad spirits or imps."</p>

<p class='c000'>"They are good angels," returned Dupr√®s coldly; "the
ill angels have but three letters in their names; but if Your
Graces are not silent these will not speak."</p>

<p class='c000'>At this the young knights forbore, and the skryer continued
to gaze into the crystal which now appeared a ball
of fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They speak," he said; "they reprove the princely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Counts for playing with eternal mysteries in a spirit of
lightness. Kendrick says, 'Is life so long that you can be
so careless of time? Be careful in your comings and in
your goings, lest you waste precious moments, and death
come upon you unawares, and snatch you away in your
prime.' Volvangel says, 'Why would you know the
future? It is better not to draw the curtain.' And now
they fall to pieces as if they were of ashes, and there is no
more of them."</p>

<p class='c000'>The globe was now radiating such intense light that
though it was motionless it appeared to spin in its place.
Duke Christopher rose and put out the lamp, but the
chamber remained lit with a delicate, soft, and flickering
glow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The skryer now appeared of an ashy paleness, drops of
sweat stood on his brow, his lips trembled. He spoke
again in a hoarse and unnatural voice‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Liliana has arisen; it is a female angel, very witty
and wise‚Äîshe is coming into the room."</p>

<p class='c000'>A broad beam of golden light projected from the
globe and fell, like the vast blade of a sword, against the
dimmer light of the chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is Liliana," repeated the skryer. "She runs about
the room."</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a moment's utter silence, then Adolphus unexpectedly
cried out‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"I see her! She wears a gown of flowered tabinet and
yellow hair rolled up in front and hanging long behind!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is she," said Dupr√®s. "She is standing now by
the knee of His Highness, and she bids him remember that
the angels of God are more to be believed than any priest
or Pope."</p>

<p class='c000'>"She fades!" cried Adolphus. "She changes into a
wheel of fire‚Äîshe breaks‚Äîshe goes!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"She has returned to the crystal," said the skryer.
"She asks what you want of her?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us know the future," said Count Louis. "Let us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>know the fate of the four who sit here‚Äînot from wanton
curiosity or irreverent meddling in matters beyond us‚Äîbut
that, with God's help, we may know how to shape our
lives as becomes men and Princes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"She says," replied Dupr√®s, in the same tense tone, "that
it is best you should not know, but she can answer your
questions‚Äîone question to each knight."</p>

<p class='c000'>Adolphus spoke first‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Shall I gain honour before I die?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The answer is‚Äî'Great honour.'"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who will our wives be?" asked Duke Christopher.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The answer is‚Äî'All three shall die unwed.'"</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis of Nassau, almost as pale as the skryer, raised his
fair face as he put his question‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Will the House of Nassau endure, or fall into decay?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The answer is‚Äî'This House will endure as long as
there are Princes on earth.'"</p>

<p class='c000'>William of Orange spoke now; it was the first word he
had said since the skryer had commenced‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"What manner of death shall we die?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Liliana says she may not tell, but that in the crystal
will come visions."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Enough, enough," cried Adolphus, rising. "I will
not meddle with these matters‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>But the others caught him back to his seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Hear it to the end," said Louis.</p>

<p class='c000'>The strong beam had now disappeared from the globe,
which burnt suddenly dim with a sullen fire that lit the red
table-cover and left the rest of the room in darkness; the
skryer now seemed to be in a trance or swoon, he swayed
to and fro the crystal, his face was blank as virgin paper,
his eyes like glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I see blood," he muttered, "nothing but blood and
black horses‚Äîand men. It is a battle‚Äîthe sun is setting‚Äîagain
the blood, there are four knights trampled under
the horses‚Äîone is taken from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">m√™l√©e</span> and his bones laid
in holy ground. The other three disappear‚Äîthere is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>search for them, they are not found. They are all young.
The blood and smoke clears. I see trees, I see an older man,
worn, grey, murdered‚Äîthere is great lamentation‚Äîand
now the black curtain falls‚Äîfalls."</p>

<p class='c000'>All the light in the globe went out, and the skryer
dropped forward across the magic table. William sprang
up, opened the door, and called for lights.</p>

<p class='c000'>A servant instantly brought a lamp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis and Christopher were calmly in their places, but
Adolphus had his head bowed forward in his hands and
was shuddering.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Herr Jesus! I saw her!" he murmured. "A little
maid‚Äîand is there a bloody death for all of us?"</p>

<p class='c000'>But William's serene laugh, the flood of light, the stir
and move of ordinary things about them swept away the
sense of dread and mystery; the skryer sighed, stirred
from his stupor, and began packing up his appliances. He
did not seem disposed to speak and the knights did not
urge it; they severally left to change their armour, on
which still lay the dust of the tourney.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince lingered last; he put a purse of thalers into
Dupr√®s' hand and thanked him courteously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Seigneur," said the skryer with emotion, "I will tell
no one but I will tell you, who are a very prudent Prince,
that those knights I saw slain had the faces of your brothers‚Äîof
Count Louis, Count Adolphus, and one who is not
here, and Duke Christopher."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And the murdered man?" asked William, turning on
him his powerful eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was Your Highness," replied Dupr√®s, bowing his
head.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All of us!" said the Prince lightly. "Was it John
you saw, or Henry‚Äîthat third cavalier?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was not His Grace, John, but one younger whom I
have never seen."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was a fearful vision," said William, "and maybe
it was but some distempered fancy. Yet," he added, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>sudden gravity, "if honour called, the House of Nassau
would make even the sacrifice you saw prefigured."</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled at the skryer in the fashion which made all
men his friends, and hastened away to the festivals at the
town hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the city belfries rocked with the ringing of the
joy-bells, again the summer night was lit with splendid
illuminations, and all the sweet languor of this rich season
of the year was blended with the magnificence of princely
rejoicings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young grandee crossing the town square lifted his
eyes to the stars and gazed at those three which form a
diamond sword in the heavens.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII<br /> BRUSSELS</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>After the third day of tourney had completed the
marriage festivities, the Prince of Orange, his bride,
and their train‚Äîswelled now by Anne's attendants‚Äîset
out for Brussels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Vanderlinden was among the magnificent assembly who
wished them God-speed, and he found occasion to hand
R√©n√®e le Meung a charm in the shape of the figure seven
cut in jade and set with little studs of gold. This would,
he said, keep her from harm while she resided in Brussels,
for seven was the lucky number of that city which was
under the direct influence of the seven planets, and owned
seven churches, seven gates, and seven senators.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e thanked him with tears in her eyes and a sad
smile on her lips as she turned to leave the land that had
been a refuge, even if in exile, and set her face towards
her own country which was so full of peril for her and
contained unutterable memories.</p>

<p class='c000'>Already, from those in the Prince's train and from such
Saxons as had been in Brussels, she had heard much of
the state of affairs in the Low Countries. The Inquisition,
which the late Emperor had established in the Netherlands,
had always been resisted, notably in Brabant (into
two of the provinces it had never been introduced), with
such effect that, though an avowed heretic (as was R√©n√®e's
father) was certain to be apprehended, yet many who
were not of the orthodox faith had managed to live quietly
and unmolested. Now, however, it was being enforced with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>great severity by Philip's orders and Granvelle's warm
support, and the chief Inquisitor, Peter Titelmann, was
performing his office with the ruthlessness and cruelty of
Torquemada himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one even suspected of heresy, anyone who did
not bow low enough when the Host passed, anyone who
read the Bible or ventured to criticize the priests or preach
any contrary doctrines, was at once seized by Titelmann,
accused before his secret Tribunal from which there was
no appeal, tortured to force a confession, and finally put
to death in the most horrid fashion the monks could devise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Already this monstrous tyranny was spreading over the
Low Countries with a combined force and power impossible
to resist, the religious force of the Pope, the secular force
of the King behind it. Already Titelmann, Granvelle, the
Regent, the King, were rejoicing that they were tearing up
by the roots the seed that Martin Luther had planted;
already some of the most splendid and prosperous towns
in Europe were being devastated with executions, fines,
confiscations, and the spectacle of tortured men, women,
and children flung living into the flames with Marot's
hymns on their lips and the light of undiminished faith
in their eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>And this was only the beginning.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no length to which the King was not prepared
to go to re-establish the pure Catholic faith in his dominions.
He was willing to depopulate cities, render barren the
countryside, ruin the trade from which he drew so handsome
a revenue, force into revolt the people who had been
his father's faithful subjects‚Äîin brief, to utterly destroy
and scatter one of the bravest, most prosperous, most
intelligent, most thrifty nations of Europe rather than see
them tainted with the doctrines of Luther or Calvin.</p>

<p class='c000'>And to this resolve Cardinal Granvelle gave his enthusiastic
support.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e heard enough of the prelate to realize that he
was nearly as dreaded and disliked as Titelmann himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>and that to him was ascribed the enforcing of the Inquisition
and the creation of the hated new bishoprics by
which the supremacy of the true faith was to be enforced
and the organization of the Inquisition maintained. It
was from the creation of these bishoprics and his own
elevation to the See of Mechlin and then to the Cardinal's
Hat, that the growth of the breach between Anthony
Perrenot and his one-time patron, the Prince of Orange,
might be traced; and R√©n√®e learnt that William, together
with Lamoral Egmont, Prince of Gravern and Stadtholder
of Artois and Flanders (abetted by Philip de Montmorency,
Count Hoorne, then at the Spanish Court), had actually
written a letter to Philip protesting against the increasing
insolence and presumption of the Cardinal, and that the
King on receiving the message had warmly defended
Granvelle, and so abused Count Hoorne that that nobleman
had hardly been able, from wrath and amazement,
to leave the royal presence. These circumstances, which
were common talk in the Netherlands, and rousing immense
interest and speculation, caused R√©n√®e to regard her new
master with added curiosity, with a growing respect;
from the first moment she had seen him she had felt his
charm, now she began to surmise his power.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along the journey she marked his patience, gentleness,
and courtesy with Anne's unreasonable jealous affection,
peevish tempers, and fits of hysteric gloom. Some of
the other women laughed at so much softness, but R√©n√®e
admired this gentleness in one whom she knew could be
masterful and believed could be fierce, but it had the effect
of rousing her former half-compassionate indifference
towards Anne into active dislike.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never had the sickly bad-tempered girl seemed so hateful
to R√©n√®e as she did now when plaguing the husband
she professed to adore, chattering over her coming triumphs
in Brussels, and boasting of her new rank and dignities.
She seemed to see in the magnificent and tumultuous
scene on to which she was about to enter only a stage on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>which to display her own enormous vanity, and her infinite
petty questions and speculations as to her position in relation
to the Regent and the ladies of her Court fatigued
R√©n√®e almost beyond endurance, for the waiting-woman's
mind was full of the great problems now agitating her
native country, and of the coming struggle between Prince
and Cardinal, of which Anne was so entirely in ignorance.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they reached the beautiful plains of Brabant,
and the hill-built capital, Anne fell ill from the excess of
her own spleen and passions, and it was on a litter that
she was carried into her husband's gorgeous home on the
heights of Brussels.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was an establishment that filled R√©n√®e with astonishment,
and was indeed much more splendid then even the
Saxon Princess had ever expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>Situated in the most beautiful part of the ornate and
rich city, and amid the residences of other great nobles,
the Nassau palace formed a fitting scene for the festivals,
the hospitality, the pageants provided by one of the most
wealthy and generous Princes in Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The turreted and gabled mansion, crowned by a tower
or belfry, and built in the most elaborate style of Gothic
art, stood in fine gardens filled with statues, fountains,
pleasant walks, exotic shrubs, summer-houses, and fishponds,
all laid out at great expense and lavishly maintained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rooms, halls, galleries, and cabinets were most
handsomely and luxuriously furnished with all the famous
rich splendour of the Netherlands; tapestries, hangings,
pictures by the most renowned artists; carpets, rugs,
objects from the East and the Indies; all the ornate beauty
that taste could desire and wealth execute, distinguished
the dwelling of the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>The household, with stewards, secretaries, clerks,
musicians, chaplains, falconers, huntsmen, gardeners,
cooks, valets, pages, servants, and now augmented by
Anne's women, amounted to over a thousand persons, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>one of the most lavish and famous features of the establishment
was the perpetual banquet kept in one of the
halls, from which extravagant hospitality was indiscriminately
extended to all comers at any hour of the day and
night. The dishes, fruits, confectionery, and wines were
constantly replenished, but never removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this household, beside which that of the Elector was
simple indeed, R√©n√®e felt herself utterly alien and overwhelmed;
but during the first days of her residence there,
while in attendance on Anne's nervous illness, she observed,
as closely as she was able, him who had already so excited
her curiosity, namely, the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>She found he was good-tempered with all, loved by all,
extravagant, reckless of his own interests, and very much
the master.</p>

<p class='c000'>From her high window, round which the pigeons flew,
she would wait for a glimpse of those who came to wait
on him: Egmont, the Stadtholder of Artois and Flanders,
as magnificent a lord as William himself, and of almost as
proud and ancient descent; Count Hoorne, another great
seigneur, but a sombre and gloomy man; Brederode, handsome,
reckless, usually inflamed with wine; Count Hoorne's
brother, the Seigneur de Montigny; and De la Marck, the
Seigneur de Lumey.</p>

<p class='c000'>And R√©n√®e soon perceived that these great nobles were
all animated with one object, and that object hatred of
Cardinal Granvelle.</p>

<p class='c000'>How far the Prince was heading these malcontents she
could not tell; she noticed that though he was so gay,
and appeared so open, he was not reckless in speech, and
she divined that he was reserved and prudent in all serious
matters; she believed, too, that his position was difficult,
even perilous. If so, certainly his new wife contributed
nothing to soothe either difficulties or perils; indeed, her
behaviour would have hampered any man. In her vanity
and arrogance she was ungracious to his friends; she
quarrelled with Egmont's wife, who was the sister of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Elector Palatine, on the question of precedence; and she
chose to consider herself injured because the Regent kept
her waiting when she first went to pay her duty.</p>

<p class='c000'>But though she was behaving like a fretful child, she
could not fail to be an important pawn in the great game
that was beginning to be played in the Netherlands, and
R√©n√®e wondered who would try to rouse her to a sense of
her position, for at present she was showing capricious
favour to the Cardinal's party by patronizing the wives
of his creatures, Aerschot and Barlaymont.</p>

<p class='c000'>The warning, or advice, came most unexpectedly from
Sabina of Bavaria, Countess of Egmont, Princess of
Gravern‚Äîthe lady whose only previous acquaintance with
Anne had been haughty disputes as to their order of
precedency.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Egmont's wife was not the woman to endanger her
husband's interests by feminine vanities; she came
personally to offer her friendship to Anne and to instil
the good counsel the Saxon Princess so sorely needed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne, though tolerably flattered at the visit, received
her rival with the haughtiness she deemed due to her
station, retaining with her R√©n√®e and a little German girl
who waited on her, and barely rising when the Countess
(she was generally known, as was her husband, by her
prouder title of Egmont) entered her presence.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e had been told by her mistress that Sabina of
Bavaria was an old woman, ill-favoured, but the waiting-woman
found that the Countess was as splendid as Anne was
mean, as courtly as Anne was rude, as fascinating as Anne
was unattractive. After the first few moments of commonplace
compliments, it was plain that the Princess of Orange
did not know how to behave; she sat in the window-seat
eating nuts, which she held in the lap of her brilliant blue
satin gown, and the shells of which she cast from her
window.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Countess of Egmont, leaning back in her dark
chair, her delicate tired face framed in the high rich ruff,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>her soft hair threaded with pearls, in all graceful, composed,
and gracious, surveyed the Princess through half-closed
long eyes and, seeing that all subtlety would be
wasted on Anne, came directly to the point.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness has already some knowledge of how
matters stand in Brussels?" she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>"None at all," replied Anne flippantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Naturally Your Highness has had little opportunity,"
said the Countess pleasantly. "I have been some while
at the Court and can enlighten you on some particulars."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is best for ladies not to meddle in these matters,"
remarked Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Truly, we women play a poor small part in these great
affairs," smiled the other lady. "None the less we may be
of some use and help. You have observed the great discontent
there is against Cardinal Granvelle, how all the
seigneurs are against him, especially your lord and mine?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Prince does not talk business with me," said Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Countess bit her pretty lip.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I speak as a sister of a Protestant to a Protestant,"
she continued. "Your ladies are of the Reformed Faith?"
she added, glancing at R√©n√®e and the other girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh yes," said the Princess, roused at last, "but I
assure Your Grace that we shall give no trouble. I have
promised to live Catholicly, and I will keep my word."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I did not mean to speak of that," returned the Countess
gently, "only to say that his princely Highness, your
husband, has always been considered too lenient to those
of the Reformed Faith, has always Count Louis with him,
and continually others of his relations who are Lutheran,
and this has been used as a handle against him by the
Cardinalists, and will be even more so now that he has a
Protestant wife."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And what is the upshot of this speech?" asked Anne,
hardly pretending to disguise her impatience.</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont's wife replied with the serene grandeur that
was so infinitely patient.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>"To explain I must weary Your Highness with some
business. Cardinal Granvelle is already endeavouring
to enforce the Inquisition in the Netherlands‚Äîsome
hundreds have already suffered under his instigation.
Now the late Emperor, and the Queen Mary, the late
Regent, did promise this should not be, and to break
those oaths is against the conscience of many good
Catholics and of most of the great lords, save only
Aerschot, Barlaymont, and Meghem, who fawn on the
Cardinal; but Granvelle wishes to enforce the edicts
issued by the late Emperor against heretics, and this the
seigneurs consider a fatal course. So there is a powerful
party against this priest, and a letter has already been
writ to the King against him."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I hear he is very upstart and of low birth," remarked
Anne, who was incapable of grasping the wide aspects of
the question put before her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is no matter," smiled Sabina; "he is favourite
at Madrid. And <em>he</em> rules the Netherlands, not Madame
Parma."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I heard the Seigneur Brederode speak of him the
other day," said Anne, with an affected laugh. "He
made some fine jests on him! He said he wore those
fox-tails in his cap as a memory of the old fox, as he called
Granvelle, and frequented the masks in a Cardinal's gown
to do His Eminence a spite!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Seigneur Brederode is reckless," returned the
Countess gravely, "and does us little good."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, I think he is amusing," said Anne perversely.
"He told me some fine stories of the Cardinal," and she
laughed coarsely.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sabina knit her brows.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Beware of laughing at the Seigneur Brederode's tales,"
she said. "I tell you his pastimes are dangerous."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne shrugged her shoulders as she replied‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"What has your princely Grace to say at the end of
this?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Egmont's wife flushed; she was not used to the rudeness
she was so patiently enduring from this ill-bred
girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wish Your Highness to be one of us," she said, "to
help us. To be ductile, circumspect, to submit to the
Regent‚Äîto give no confidences to Aerschot's wife."</p>

<p class='c000'>"She is my husband's kinswoman," interrupted Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>"She is of the Cardinal's party," flashed the Countess,
"and they are none of them to be trusted. I appeal to
you," she added with dignity, "to stand by us, who are
standing by those of your faith. I tell you, King Philip
is only waiting for the decision of the Council at Trent to
force all his subjects into conformity with the ancient faith‚Äîyea,
even at the price of depopulating the Netherlands.
I tell you no liberty, no charter, no privilege will be
safe, nay, not 'the joyous entry' itself, and we must all
turn into persecutors‚Äîscourgers in Granvelle's hand‚Äîor
be ruined."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne was now a little frightened; she dimly wondered
what her own position would be if all these fearful edicts
against heretics were enforced.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What can I do?" she asked foolishly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bear yourself discreetly‚Äîflatter the Regent, eschew
the Cardinalists‚Äîdo not encourage Seigneur Brederode."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am sure no one takes any notice of what I do,"
returned Anne. In her heart she was sorry she was not
an orthodox Catholic; the sufferings of fellow-heretics
did not move her in the least, but she was alarmed at the
thought of being involved in any of their misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The actions of the daughter of the Prince who forced
the Peace of Passau from the late C√¶sar must always be
important."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne was flattered at this; she was always inordinately
proud of her famous father, while not sympathizing in the
least with the principles or the actions that had made him
glorious.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I will do what I can in the matters you tell me of," she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>said, "but it was never my husband's wish that I should
be troubled with grave business of any kind."</p>

<p class='c000'>Sabina took this ungracious concession as the utmost
she was likely to get; she rose, feeling that the whole
interview had been rather useless.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne rose too, and as she stood, the bright cruel light
of the window over her, the other woman noted afresh
how crooked she was, how sickly, how plain, and was
sorry.</p>

<p class='c000'>And over Anne's shoulder she glanced into the gardens
which showed through the open casement, and saw the
Prince playing tennis in the sunlit court; his gay spirits,
his splendid health, his pleasant handsomeness formed
a bitter contrast with his wife. The Countess, with the
generosity of the woman who has everything, felt sorry
indeed for this woman who had nothing but a position
she could not hold, and a husband she could not please.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ladies parted, and Anne called for wine and sugar,
mixed herself a sweet drink, and presently fell into a
flushed sleep in the window-seat. She was still asleep
when the Prince came up from his game.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at her in silence, rather sternly, rejected
R√©n√®e's offer to wake her, and went away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waiting-woman kept her distasteful vigil during
the rest of the long sunny afternoon. The little German
girl crept away; the sounds of the palace came dimly
through the shut doors, without the pigeons flew to and
fro with a sharp flap of wings, and R√©n√®e sat motionless,
with locked hands and compressed lips, her mind and
soul in the struggle between Granvelle who stood for
the tyranny of Philip and the power of Rome, and the
great nobles who stood for the liberty of the Netherlands
and the protection of the wretched heretics.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> MARGARET OF PARMA</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>The Governess of the Netherlands, Margaret,
daughter of the late Emperor and wife of Ottavio
Farnese, Duke of Parma, sat in her chair of state
in the small chamber leading to the council room, and
before her were the three Netherland nobles who were the
avowed enemies of Granvelle, and who had complained so
long and haughtily that they were no longer consulted
and that the Regent took advice solely from the Cardinal
and his creatures, Barlaymont, President of the Council
of Finance, and Viglius, President of the Privy Council.</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret favoured the Cardinal; he had an immense
influence over her, and she knew him to be as deep in her
brother Philip's counsels as his father had been for thirty
years in those of the Emperor; but the situation in the
Netherlands was increasingly difficult, and she dared not
alienate men of such importance as the three that were
before her now‚Äîthe brilliant Egmont, victor of Gravelines
and St. Quentin; Hoorne, Admiral of Flanders; and Orange,
the most powerful of the Princes and Stadtholders in the
States.</p>

<p class='c000'>She sat now erect and a little drawn back against the
burnished leather of her seat, rather in the attitude of one
at bay. Her presence was majestic and graceful, with something
of the commanding fascination which had made her
father so popular; but the Flemish blood of her commoner
mother told too‚Äîshe lacked refinement and softness;
her features were bold and haughty, her brow heavy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>her upper lip shaded with dark hair; her hands were
large and strong, and seemed ill-adapted for the embroidery
they now held; indeed, her most notable accomplishment
was horsemanship, as it had been that of her aunt, the
former Regent, Mary of Hungary.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her attire of gold brocade and black velvet, stiff cap
and flowing veil of black tissue folded over her shoulders,
was more rich than tasteful; she wore no jewellery nor
adornments, for she affected a masculine strength of character
and disdain of detail.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her needle went in and out of the embroidery; but the
work was largely a pretence, and the flower she was making
was stitched false, for her full brown eyes were continually
glancing from one to the other of the three before her.
Count Hoorne was speaking; in words slow but full of
intense feeling he was putting before her the nobles' case
against the Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Admiral stood by the pointed window on which
gleamed the arms of Brabant in the leaded glass‚Äîa grave
and gloomy figure, dark and careless in attire, with a
haughty and rather sad face, brooding eyes, a discontented
brow, and black fan-shaped beard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Standing behind him, leaning against a side table
covered with a small cloth of Persia, was Lamoral Egmont,
the famous soldier, the popular grandee, Knight of the
Golden Fleece, Stadtholder of Brabant and Artois.</p>

<p class='c000'>Half his exceptional popularity he owed to his unusual
good looks, his beautiful head with the brown curls carried
so splendidly, his soldier's figure tall and strong, his noble
port, the brilliancy of his attire. His silk and brocades,
jewels and gold, showed the more gorgeous now in contrast
with Hoorne.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaning against the wall near him was the Prince of
Orange; he had a quiet air, and his head was bent forward
on his ruff. He was not so magnificent as Egmont, though
his appointments were very splendid.</p>

<p class='c000'>And always Margaret's eyes were flashing up covertly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>from her sewing and measuring the sombre proud speaker,
the gorgeous grandee behind him, and that third figure
with the bent head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoorne finished at length, bowed to the Regent, and
looked at his colleagues.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You bring very vague accusations, princely count," said
Margaret. Her voice was heavy and she spoke haltingly,
for she was at ease with no language save Italian. "It
would seem that there is nothing against the Cardinal but
private spites and malices."</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is against him," replied Lamoral Egmont,
"that he usurps our place in the Council, as we have
endeavoured to show Your Royal Grace."</p>

<p class='c000'>The embroidery trembled in Margaret's fingers. "You
blame him for much that he has not done," she said "as,
the bishoprics."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you tell us," cried Hoorne impetuously, "that the
Cardinal did not urge these bishoprics at Rome?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay," replied the Duchess. "They were intended in
the Emperor's time‚Äîbefore I, or the Cardinal, came to
the Netherlands."</p>

<p class='c000'>"At least he enforces them and enjoys the finest,"
persisted Hoorne, unconvinced.</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret lifted her bold eyes; they were angry eyes now.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He enforces them," she said, "because it is His
Majesty's wish, and the Cardinal is loyal‚ÄîI would all were
as he! And why are these bishoprics so odious? Methinks
they should be comforting to good Catholics"‚Äîshe
darted a sharp glance at the Prince of Orange‚Äî"since
they are designed to strengthen the ancient faith and rout
out heresy."</p>

<p class='c000'>"They are designed to support and spread the Inquisition,"
replied Hoorne bluntly, "and that is a thing odious
to these States."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Spanish Inquisition shall not be introduced,"
answered Margaret. "That has been promised."</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is no need to introduce it," said the Admiral
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>dryly. "The Inquisition of the Netherlands is more
severe."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The people will not take it, indeed they will not," said
the Stadtholder of Brabant earnestly. "As witness the
disturbances, riots, and revolts at Titelmann's executions."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We are not talking of the people," replied the Regent,
with bitter vexation, "nor of their grievances, but of the
great lords who foster all this sedition, and seem to have
a marvellous sympathy for heretics."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have a marvellous respect for the charters and
privileges of the States which are in our keeping," said the
Prince of Orange, "and which the Inquisition utterly
defies and overrules."</p>

<p class='c000'>Tears of vexation sprang into Margaret's eyes; more than
either of the other two was this Prince vexatious to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, Prince," she said, "we know your dispositions.
You hide yourself behind the States, behind charters and
privileges; but, as my brother said in the matter of the
Spanish troops, it is not the States, but you‚Äîand I perceive
it, never believe but that I perceive it."</p>

<p class='c000'>William very slightly smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have never failed in duty to the King," he replied,
"nor loyalty to the Church. And in protesting against the
Cardinal and his measures, I do believe, Madame, that I
serve the best interests of both."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is well," said Margaret bitterly, "for you to speak
of loyalty to the Church when your palace shelters heretics
and you have a Lutheran wife."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I had His Majesty's consent to my marriage," said
William quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A reluctant one," returned the Regent, "and His
Majesty is still not pleased that you should choose the
daughter of the Elector Maurice‚Äîbut that is past," she
added sharply, then, with a thrust at the daughter of the
man who had humiliated her father, "though we think
the match still imprudent, and marvel at it more than
formerly."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>William received this reference to his wife with courteous
indifference, and Margaret continued with raised voice,
the deep colour mounting to her hard face and the embroidery
lying forgotten on her lap.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Methinks it would be more dutiful and fitting if you
offered to help me with your advices and influences instead
of filling my ears with complaints of the only man who is
useful to me."</p>

<p class='c000'>Lamoral Egmont drew his magnificent person erect.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have no opportunity of aiding Your Grace," he
said, "since we have been excluded so long from your
Councils."</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret trembled with anger.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you want of me?" she asked, driven to
desperation.</p>

<p class='c000'>That was too complex a matter for either the Prince of
Orange or Count Hoorne to commit themselves to, but
Lamoral Egmont, who was neither cautious nor wise,
answered instantly‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"The withdrawal of Cardinal Granvelle from the Netherlands."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duchess rose in her agitation, sweeping her needlework
to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ho, you ask no little thing of me!" she cried in her
indignation. "How think you the King would take that
request?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let Your Grace make it," replied the Stadtholder of
Brabant, with a touch of insolence. "And, while we wait
an answer from Madrid, let Your Grace counsel the Cardinal
to comport himself with less overbearing arrogance."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Arrogance!" flashed Margaret. "What of the Count
Brederode, who nightly, when in drink, sports Cardinal's
attire at some public mask, and mocks and flouts His Eminence
with huge indecency? What of the pasquils that
reach my very closet and are thrust under the Cardinal's
pillow? What of these vile rhetoric plays which no
punishment can stop and which jeer at all holy things?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>"We know none of any of this," declared Hoorne, with
rising anger.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Henry Brederode is not my charge," said Egmont,
"nor do I control his frolics."</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret stopped short before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What of the fox-tails in your own cap?" she asked.
"You wear them openly in the street. Do you think that
I do not know of these things?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince of Orange here interposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If the bishoprics and the Inquisition, the ancient
placards and edicts, are to be forced on the people, there
is no chance of the States passing the new taxes."</p>

<p class='c000'>These words instantly brought the Regent to the practical
part of the matter, and affected her more than any of
the proud speeches of Egmont and Hoorne. The finances
of the Netherlands were in a miserable condition. Philip
was always demanding money, being continually embarrassed
himself, and Margaret feared for her prestige, if
not for her position, if she could not supply it; and cordially
as she agreed with her brother's proposal to exterminate
all heresy in his dominions, and greatly as she admired
Granvelle's plans to carry the Royal wishes into effect, she
was shrewd enough to see that the Prince had pointed out
a real difficulty, and one that she had lately been acutely
conscious of.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time, she disliked the Prince bitterly for
calling her attention to this stumbling-block.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you threaten disobedience‚Äîrebellion?" she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I threaten nothing," replied William, looking at her
calmly. "I speak of what I know of the States. The
Stadtholders will not enforce the Inquisition, the people
will not submit to it. Rebellion? Who knows? The
provinces have revolted before, Madame, against the House
of Hapsburg."</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret was silent, her eyes narrowed with anger. Her
sincere convictions were with the Cardinal. As an ardent
Catholic, she loathed the heretics; as a grateful subject of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>her brother, she wished to obey his wishes. She was loyal,
industrious, and ambitious to render a good account of her
charge. She believed the men before her, and those whom
they represented, to be greedy, jealous self-seekers, and
she despised them as mere worldly courtiers; but to the
Prince of Orange's argument she was obliged to listen.
She was shrewd enough to see that these men knew the
Netherlanders as neither she, Philip, nor Granvelle did; and
she respected the abilities of the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>She stood eyeing them all; her hand on her hip, her
head well up.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We cannot obey His Majesty in both things," continued
William. "We cannot enforce the edicts and raise
the revenues."</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret knew this to be so true that she controlled her
choler, though her eyes were bright with anger.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The placards will not be enforced," she replied. "His
Majesty waits the decision of the Council of Trent‚Äîif that
allow a certain latitude to heretics, His Majesty will obey."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If not?" asked William.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duchess flung out her hands with a gesture of
annoyance and desperation.</p>

<p class='c000'>"How do I know what the King will do? I am here
to execute his orders. I can but ask that the Inquisitors
deal gently until some decision is known."</p>

<p class='c000'>The three grandees took this as a concession, almost a
confession of defeat on the part of Margaret, as it indeed
was; nothing but a deep sense of the difficulties and
perils of her position could have wrung such words from her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And Your Grace will advise moderation to the
Cardinal?" asked William, taking up his hat.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do that errand yourself, noble Prince, since you are
responsible," replied the Regent keenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>William unexpectedly laughed, and turned his charming
face with a gay look of amusement towards the angry
lady.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Truly I will," he said. "His Eminence and I used to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>know each other well, and I cannot think that old friendship
worn so thin that he would refuse me an hour's
hospitality at La Fontaine."</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret saw that she had been betrayed into an imprudence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do what you will," she said, "but on your own
authority."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Grace is vexed," remarked Hoorne, "but we
have done nothing but our plain duty."</p>

<p class='c000'>"God grant Your Grace may come to see it so," added
the courteous Egmont.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And may He set great prudence and clemency in your
heart, Madame," said the Prince, still smiling, "for we
stand on the edge of chance, and may easily mis-tread."</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret dismissed them as haughtily as she dared, and
as soon as they had gone sat down to write an agitated
letter to Philip, full of the obstinacy of the Netherlands,
the insolence of the grandees, the impossibility of obtaining
money, and the virtues of the much-abused Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The three grandees mounted and rode along the city
heights where their homes lay among pleasant parks and
beautiful gardens; as they ascended the steep, winding
streets they could look back at the town lying in the
hollow, ornate and gorgeous, proud and serene beneath
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The twin towers of Saint Gudule rose majestically from
above the clustered house roofs, below them soared the
immense spire of the Town Hall, and in the blue cloudiness
and golden light of the late summer afternoon dozens of
gilt weathercocks swung in the gentle breeze and glittered
in the sun, and in and out of the crevices of the gables
flashed the white wings of innumerable pigeons.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince of Orange glanced often at this prospect of
the fair town; but Lamoral Egmont's eyes were for the
bending knee and lowered head of passers-by, the curtsies
of women spinning at the doors, the bright eyes of maidens
peeping with admiration from behind the chequered casement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>blinds; and the Admiral's gaze was straight before
him, as if he saw nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Think you the Regent meant what she said?" he asked
at length.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think she was frightened," said the Stadtholder of
Brabant.</p>

<p class='c000'>"She is not a clever woman," remarked the Prince of
Orange. He turned his head stiffly in the great ruff and
smiled at Hoorne. "I think she will render an ill account
of her charge. She grows more confused every day."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why did His Majesty send a woman at all?" complained
Hoorne fiercely.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Because he wanted one not too strong," replied
William. "It were wise to endeavour to restrain Brederode,"
he added. "His jests against the Cardinal are very
daring, and may involve us all."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who is to argue with Brederode?" asked Egmont.
"He and De la Marck are beyond all reason; and if their
jests vex Granvelle, I am not the man to stop them."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Granvelle smiles at jests; there are better ways to
discomfit him than the drunken frolics of Brederode,"
returned William.</p>

<p class='c000'>The conversation ceased, for they had entered a narrow
street where their voices could easily be heard. Their talk
turned on falconry.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wish I could get away for a while," said William.
"The Elector gave me the prettiest hunting dog, as white
as snow, and I would very willingly try him in the campaign.
If I am to be ruined by the falconers, I would use them!"
he laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Herr Jesus! how they cost!" sighed Lamoral Egmont,
who was even deeper in debt than the Prince. "Never
were the ducats so hard to come by, never were they so
much needed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Granvelle has the ducats," broke out Hoorne, regardless
of prudence. "The abbeys, benefices, and plunder
that have come his way would set us all at ease."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>And the Admiral's swarthy face darkened with wrath
and jealousy; indeed, Granvelle's persistent greed, and the
lavish manner in which Philip satisfied it, was the chief
reason of the hatred in which the nobles held the Cardinal,
as his supposed patronage of the bishoprics and the Inquisition
was the chief reason for the hatred of the people.</p>

<p class='c000'>William lifted his brows and smiled meaningly; Lamoral
Egmont shrugged his shoulders as if he could not bear to
consider the subject.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so they went their way slowly, their equipments
shining in the sun. The children ran to the doors to look
after them, and the women whispered, "There go the
two Stadtholders and the Admiral! Look what splendid
princes they are!"</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX<br /> CARDINAL GRANVELLE</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Anthony Perrenot, Archbishop of Mechlin,
Cardinal Granvelle, chief adviser to the Regent and
the chief reliance of Philip in the Netherlands, as
he was the chief object of the detestation of the Netherlanders,
grandees and people alike, spent most of his time
in his beautiful country house outside the gates of Brussels,
surrounded by all that elegant luxury and worldly extravagance
which particularly aroused the wrath of his
enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>His position with the King his master was as secure as
any man's could be with Philip, and he flattered himself
that he had an influence not easily shaken over the mind
of the Regent, who was by no means the strong and masculine
character she appeared, but one easily influenced,
as Philip well knew when he sent her to the Netherlands
with Granvelle to stand behind her chair and pull the
strings of government over her shoulder; he had also
some supporters among the nobles, notably the Duke of
Aerschot, Barlaymont, and Viglius.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the rest, he stood alone in an atmosphere of hatred,
contempt, and insult, even perhaps peril, for he believed
that he was in constant danger of assassination. But the
Burgundian priest preserved his serene calm, for he was
absolutely fearless, sincerely loyal to his master and his
Church, and intensely ambitious; and courage, loyalty, and
ambition combined to hold him steadfastly in the place to
which all three had called him and now kept him.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>On this day of the hot waning autumn he finished his
usual voluminous dispatch to Philip with particular
pleasure, for he had been able to give his master definite
news of the misdeeds of his enemies, against whom he
had been cunningly and gently insinuating complaints for
some while past.</p>

<p class='c000'>That morning Barlaymont had come to him with the
information that he had been approached to join a league
of the grandees, the sole object of which was to force the
recall or retirement of the Cardinal. Barlaymont had not
only refused to join, but had instantly disclosed all he
knew to Granvelle, who thus had been enabled to inform
his master that the chiefs of this league were Orange,
Hoorne, and Egmont, and that all the nobles had joined
them with the exception of Aerschot, Aremberg, and
Meghem.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barlaymont's information had not come as a surprise to
Granvelle; he knew perfectly well that the grandees were
working by intrigue and open opposition for his downfall,
but he was glad that they had committed themselves by
this league, and pleased that Barlaymont had proved so
faithful a tool.</p>

<p class='c000'>He added to his letter a complaint of the way in which
the Marquis of Berghen, Stadtholder of Hainault, Valenciennes,
and Cambray, and Hoorne's brother, Baron of
Montigny, Stadtholder of Tournay, refused to carry out
the decrees of the Inquisition in their several provinces.
He advised His Majesty to add these two names Berghen
and Montigny to those of Orange, Egmont, and Hoorne
as dangerous men.</p>

<p class='c000'>He also added that Viglius, though his loyalty was unquestioned,
was becoming frightened at the storm raised
in the Netherlands by the Inquisition and the rumour that
the late Emperor's edicts against heretics were to be enforced,
and was counselling moderation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Minister then sealed up his letter and went out into
his exquisite gardens, where, in consequence of the continued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>great heat, his dinner was laid on a marble table
of beautiful Greek workmanship which stood beneath a
chestnut tree now covered with tawny and golden foliage.
To-day the Cardinal took his midday meal alone; the
great nobles had long since ceased to accept his hospitality,
and he was not always in the mood to entertain those of
the lesser sort who still cared to come.</p>

<p class='c000'>His keen, intelligent mind, highly accomplished and
learned, did not disdain its own company; he found the
cultured man's pleasure in a luxurious solitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seating himself in the gilt chair, softly cushioned in
red, set for him, he glanced with pleasure at the cool white
table flecked with sunshine and the shadows of the great
chestnut leaves, at the crystal bottles of amber and ruby-coloured
wine, at the curious twisted glasses stained with
opal hues like a foam bubble, the gold service with jade
handles, the plates and dishes of porcelain as fine and
glossy as an egg-shell, the napkin of Brussels lace rich with
a design of lilies, the honey-coloured loaves lying in their
snowy linen, the fruit reposing on ice in the delicate silver
basket. The Cardinal was never wearied in his refined
enjoyment of the elegancies of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he sat over his luxurious repast admiring the mellow
light of the garden and the way his Grecian fauns and
dancers showed their marble limbs among the exotic
shrubs of laurel, myrtle, citron, and bay, his secretary
came across the grass with a paper in his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Another pasquil?" smiled the Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A fellow passing, Eminence," replied the priest, "found
this thrust into the bars of the gate."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Give him a piece of money," returned the Cardinal
carelessly, "and pray that the hand that put it there be
not the same as took it down."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Shall I leave it?" asked the secretary. "It is, as
usual, very foolish."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Leave it," replied his master. "You know I make a
collection of them."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>The priest's dark figure returned through the sunshine,
and Granvelle sipped his wine, bright as a diluted jewel in
the opal clouded glass, while his serene eyes rested on the
sheet of coarse paper roughly printed with picture and
verses in smeared black.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently he set down the wine and took up the paper
delicately in his fine, capable fingers. It contained a
hideous caricature of himself in the likeness of a hen seated
on a nest of eggs, each of which was labelled with the name
of one of the new dioceses; the shells of several were already
broken, and newly fledged bishops were hopping out of
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Granvelle was well used to such jests; the Netherlanders
were famous for their pasquils, their pamphlets, their
medals, and their rhetoric plays, and Granvelle had been the
butt of all in turn; not even the terrors of the dreaded
Inquisition itself could restrain the sharp and lively wits
of the people from ridiculing their enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Often enough they hit him on the raw, sometimes too
they went wide of the mark, as in the coarse pasquil he
held now; for, despite the general opinion to the contrary,
the Cardinal was not responsible for the creation of the new
bishoprics. He remained leaning back on his silk cushions
gazing musingly at the caricature; the sense of some one
approaching caused him to look up. Even his perfect
control could scarcely repress a start; the Prince of Orange
was coming across the grass. William made his salutation
with smiling apology for his intrusion. The Cardinal
dismissed the half-doubtful secretary, who was behind the
Prince, and motioned his guest to the seat opposite his
own.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I come without permission," said William, smiling,
"but I felt a great desire for a little speech with Your
Eminence."</p>

<p class='c000'>Granvelle's sumptuously liveried attendants were
bringing the Prince cushions, a footstool, and setting before
him wine, cakes, and fruit.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Granvelle, with a laugh, flicked the pasquil on to the
marble table.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The people become extraordinarily daring," he remarked,
accepting the Prince's presence as if it was the
usual thing for him to behold his arch-enemy at his table.
"There is a general defiance, a lawlessness abroad, very
displeasing to the servants of His Majesty."</p>

<p class='c000'>William leant back in his chair; he was still smiling;
his graceful, youthful figure, his small handsome head, his
rich attire of black velvet with rose-coloured points‚Äîall
gave him the appearance of the useless grandee many
believed him to be. But Granvelle was not so deceived;
he knew that the young cavalier smiling at him was as
astute, as experienced, as able, as wise, as prudent as himself,
and that he was the most dangerous of the many
dangerous men in the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is much abroad displeasing to the servants of
His Majesty," he answered. "I think there are perilous
times ahead."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If the grandees persist in what is near disloyalty,
yes," admitted Granvelle, and he too smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Disloyalty?" said William lightly, and raising his
fine brows. "It is a matter of terms. Our remonstrances
have been given to the Regent out of regard to our
loyalty."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I know something of your regards, Highness," replied
the Cardinal, thinking of the information he had received
that morning.</p>

<p class='c000'>William instantly took his meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Had we not wished Your Eminence to know of our
proceedings, we should scarcely have disclosed them to
Baron Barlaymont."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cardinal's fine face hardened; he set down the
peach he was handling, and took his chin in his fingers.
In the young grandee's manner was a hint of that insolence
the Burgundian priest had had to endure from the lesser
nobles like Brederode and De la Marck‚Äîthe insolence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the great towards the upstart who had been born a
commoner.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Eminence," continued William delicately,
"would be wise to retire from the Netherlands."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You came to tell me that?" asked Granvelle, almost
surprised into anger.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Netherlands will not endure the measures of
Your Eminence."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then they are rebels against the King's authority,"
replied the Cardinal proudly, "for I do nothing of myself,
but all as the instrument of Madrid; and now we are speaking
with this boldness, I tell you, <em>in the name of King
Philip</em>, to warn your friends Montigny and Berghen to be
more obedient to the commands of the Inquisition in their
provinces."</p>

<p class='c000'>William looked at the Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The King promised not to introduce the Inquisition,"
he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am not the keeper of the King's conscience," replied
the Cardinal adroitly, "but I can bear witness that His
Majesty is introducing nothing‚Äîthe Inquisition was in the
Netherlands in the Emperor's time."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But it was never enforced," replied the Prince, "and
in many provinces unknown, so that there are whole
villages, nay, townships, of those of the Reformed
Faith."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is the <em>Reformed Faith</em> or the Netherlands to
<em>you</em>?" asked Granvelle keenly‚Äî"you, a Proven√ßal prince,
a German count, a Spanish grandee, a Catholic?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"As to that," replied the Prince lightly, "I am Stadtholder
of some Netherland provinces, and one of the
advisers to the Regent, therefore I think I do well to protest
against measures which I foresee bringing ruin on His
Majesty's dominions‚Äîand I do not believe in punishing
people for their private faith."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That sentiment would be a dangerous one were you a
common man," returned the Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>"I know," smiled William, "and it is against such things
that I protest."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Tolerance for heretics is only to be expected from a
Prince united so closely to them."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps," said William indifferently; "but I was not
talking of my tolerance, but of Your Eminence's policy."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is known, clear, and will not be altered," said
Granvelle; he raised his glass and slowly sipped his wine.</p>

<p class='c000'>William leant forward across the marble table set with
the mingled luxuries of crystal and silver, and fixed his
dark eyes on the churchman's serene face.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Cardinal Granvelle," he said earnestly, "do you mean
to force the Inquisition on the Netherlands?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I mean," answered Granvelle, with his habitual evasion,
"to fulfil to the letter the commands of His Majesty."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Whatever they may be?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Most certainly‚Äîyes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Even if the King enforces the Emperor's edicts against
heresy?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"He will not do so until he knows the findings of the
Council of Trent."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But if those are in favour of greater severity against
the heretics, and the King endorses them," persisted the
Prince, "will you be the instrument to obey His Majesty?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think that Your Highness knows well enough that I
shall be that instrument," replied the Cardinal haughtily.</p>

<p class='c000'>William of Orange drew back; his expression changed to
a look of decision that was almost hard, and this unusual
sternness of his dark features so altered him that he
seemed a different person. For a second Granvelle glimpsed
the man behind the mask of the courtier.</p>

<p class='c000'>"To do what you speak of doing," said William, "is to
ruin the Netherlands. The civil officers will not obey, the
population will not submit, you will break commerce and
industry‚Äîyou will provoke a revolution."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not fear that," replied Granvelle; "the Stadtholders
are not all like Berghen and Montigny‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>"Nor all like Barlaymont. Do you think such a man as
he could do anything?" flashed William.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am not afraid," smiled the Cardinal, showing to the
full that gentle contempt for his adversaries that they had
always found so galling. "As for the grandees‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"As for the grandees," interrupted the Prince steadily,
"we are no longer boys or idle courtiers, as perhaps Your
Eminence imagines us, but men, able to play a man's game."</p>

<p class='c000'>Granvelle's smile deepened.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I never underrated the abilities of Your Highness," he
said, "but you perhaps overrate your own power; and for
the people‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The people! It is they will decide the final issue.
They are not slaves, Your Eminence, nor a conquered race,
but His Majesty's subjects through inheritance; nor is he
an absolute King here, as in Spain, but merely Count and
Lord, and bound by oath to protect the people's charters as
they to obey him. Look back a little‚Äîdid not Maximilian
do penance in the square of Bruges, and Mary go on her
knees to her own councillors? These Netherlanders are
easily pressed too far."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness threatens revolt?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I threaten nothing. I prophesy."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cardinal tossed down his lace napkin.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Even if there were a revolt," he said quietly, "it might
be crushed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It might be supported," replied William.</p>

<p class='c000'>"By the House of Nassau?" asked Granvelle.</p>

<p class='c000'>William laughed in the priest's face.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am Catholic, and His Majesty's subject," he replied,
"but there are certain neighbours who are neither who
might easily be induced to foment discontent in the
Netherlands."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Notably the relatives of Your Highness's wife?" insinuated
the Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay, they are peaceful in Saxony," said the Prince
serenely. "I was thinking of the Elector Palatine."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Granvelle made a dignified movement with his hand as
if he swept aside all the other's arguments.</p>

<p class='c000'>"His Majesty is not to be frightened by either rebellious
people, jealous nobles, nor the heretic Princes of Germany
from proceeding in his duty to God and his subjects.
Nay, I am so persuaded of the fervency of the King for
the Holy Church that I believe he could sacrifice the
Netherlands, and every soul within them, sooner than
allow them to become the breeding-ground of heresy."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And in this you would support him?" asked William
gravely.</p>

<p class='c000'>"With all my power," replied the Cardinal, "and at
peril of my life."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are a poor politician then," said the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am a good churchman," returned Granvelle calmly,
"and that is all I ever made pretence to be."</p>

<p class='c000'>"So His Majesty, you think, would sooner ruin the
Netherlands than suffer them to become heretical?"
remarked the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do believe it, and in that resolve the Duke of Alva
does support him‚Äîand myself."</p>

<p class='c000'>William rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then we who have estates in this country must look
to them, lest we be ruined too," he said, with a little smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness will pursue one way, I another,"
replied the Cardinal, rising also.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And both of us will be serving His Majesty," remarked
William gravely.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cardinal gave him a sidelong look, but the Prince's
face was impassive.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That His Majesty must decide," was the priest's
answer. Ever courteous, he now conducted his guest to
the gate where his horse and squire waited.</p>

<p class='c000'>They passed the famous statue inscribed "Durate," a
woman with an empty wine-glass in one hand and a full
glass of water in the other, by which the Cardinal sought
to symbolize the resistance of his own calm fortitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>and temperance as opposed to the extravagance and
worldliness of his enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>He called the Prince's attention to this figure.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Durate,' my motto," he remarked, with a meaning
smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A brave word," replied William. "I too have a high,
aspiring motto." He looked straightly at the priest.
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce sera Nassau, moi, je maintainerai.</span>" With that he
mounted and rode back to Brussels, while Granvelle
returned thoughtfully across his smooth lawns to his
marble table under the chestnut tree. There, leaning back
in the pleasant shade, he threw crumbs of bread to the
peacocks that came strutting across the grass at his call.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X<br /> THE RHETORIC PLAY</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>The months passed with terrible monotony for
R√©n√®e le Meung and perhaps for all at the Court
of Brussels; the long and bitter struggle between
the grandees and the Cardinal filled the air with intrigue
and dissension; the Regent began to hesitate in her
allegiance to Granvelle, and hung miserably undecided
between the two parties; Montigny had been sent to
Madrid to remonstrate with Philip, but without avail;
a second letter of protest was sent, equally fruitless; the
Cardinal, serene as always, triumphed quietly over his
enemies and continued to be the predominant influence
in the Councils of Margaret; heretics continued to be
seized and slaughtered wherever the civil authorities
could be induced to support the Inquisitors, and the
raging discontent of the people was repressed with a
heavy hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the sumptuous household of William of Orange life
went with the old magnificence but not with the old
joyousness; politically it was the rallying-point of the
grandees, who had now refused to sit in the councils with
the Cardinal, and met in William's gorgeous saloons to
discuss their plans; it was also the headquarters of
the Prince's brothers, sisters, and brothers-in-law. During
the year after his marriage, too, his German relatives
visited him there, causing great offence to the Cardinalists;
but all these comings and goings, all these intrigues,
meetings, entertainments, were clouded by two things:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>the growing embarrassment of the Prince's finances, and
the element of bitter discord provided by Anne of Saxony.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whatever the festivities or excitements might be, R√©n√®e
saw none of them; she was for ever closeted with her
mistress, who, now the Prince's quarrel with Granvelle
made her appearance at Court impossible, sulked week
after week in her rooms. She had taken a capricious
liking to have R√©n√®e, and R√©n√®e only, with her; and the
waiting-woman submitted to the slavery of her position
with a curious dumb patience.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no distraction, no change, no interest in
Anne's life. Her first child she had lost at birth, and this
had further embittered her; her one time extravagant
love for her husband, her pleasure in fine clothes and
jewels, were completely dead; she never appeared but
she created a disturbance with her temper; she refused
to admit any of the court ladies into her intimacy, and
so she remained closed within her rooms, a slattern, a
shrew, a scold, and daily becoming worse; entirely indifferent
to the great events taking place at her very
gates, but keenly alive to any detail in which she might
find excuse for complaint or fury.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e wondered why she stayed; the life was almost
intolerable, and she had had two chances of escape since
she came to Brussels: one of the Regent's secretaries had
asked her in marriage, and the Countess of Egmont was
willing to take her into her service.</p>

<p class='c000'>But R√©n√®e had declined both, and remained in the great
Nassau palace, tending her mistress with tireless devotion
and eagerly watching what news she could of the movement
of the events in which she perceived the Prince of
Orange was the leader; she was like one waiting‚Äîbut
for what she did not know. It was in the winter after the
grandees had dispatched their second letter to Philip, and
when affairs seemed to be reaching a crisis in the Netherlands,
that matters in the Nassau household reached a
climax of discord.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Anne had taken a whim to have the Prince's children by
his first marriage under her care, and had been fiercely
angered by William's decision to place his little girl in the
household of the Regent, and to keep the boy in Louvain.
As a result of this Anne kept her room for nearly a week;
but the day came when the Prince, entertaining his
friends at one of his lavish dinners, demanded her presence
as necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was, as usual, R√©n√®e's task, first to persuade her
mistress to appear, and secondly to make her fit to take
the head of the Prince's table, and, as the short afternoon
began to fail, R√©n√®e went in search of her; she found Anne
in her bedchamber hunched up against the white porcelain
stove; she was eating sweets.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e, whose natural instincts were towards the beautiful,
the refined, even the voluptuous, never came into her
mistress's presence without a sense of absolute repulsion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne, though still under twenty, was now as careless in
her dress and person as any hag of ninety; increased ill-health
had deadened her always dull complexion, her eyes
were swollen beneath, her mouth loose and ragged; her
colourless hair was gathered untidily in her neck, her
twisted figure further bent.</p>

<p class='c000'>To-day she wore a bedgown of stained dark blue velvet,
trodden-over slippers, and a soiled linen cap; yet she cost
the Prince more in clothes than ever the charming and
elegant Anne of Egmont had done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though it was not yet dark, the windows were tightly
closed and curtained, and candles flared and guttered
untidily on the various tables. The Princess had sat all day
in this artificial light, and the atmosphere of the chamber
was thick and close. As R√©n√®e entered Anne looked up.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You were out yesterday," she said, breaking the utter
silence she had preserved for two days.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, Highness, it was my hour."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where did you go?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"About the town, as always."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>"I saw you in the Gardens with Count Louis," sneered
Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I met him," replied R√©n√®e, unmoved. "We spoke
together for, I think, two minutes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why were you so late?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"There was a rhetoric play, Highness, and I was hindered
by the crowd."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is a rhetoric play?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"A morality, Highness," replied R√©n√®e patiently, "that
the poor oppressed heretics make to expose their wrongs
and strike at their tyrants."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, plays that make a jest of monks and nuns and all
those in authority!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is a grave jest," said R√©n√®e. "They do it at peril of
their lives."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Are they not often apprehended?" asked Anne
spitefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Very often, Highness, and then they are strangled or
burnt or tortured, or hacked to death with a rusty sword,
as a poor schoolmaster was the other day for reading the
Bible to his wife. And it was in her presence they slew
him, and she died of it," added R√©n√®e quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And they still persist?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ay, they still persist," repeated R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wish you would keep away from them," said the
Princess. "Do you want to involve me in this unruliness?"</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is no fear of that," she replied; "and if they are
bold enough to perform, I am bold enough to be of the
audience, Highness."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do not come to <em>me</em>, if you are taken," said Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I shall come to no one. I am not afraid to die as the
others do, when the time comes," replied R√©n√®e, laying out
and making ready Anne's garments for the evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you mean by 'when the time comes'?"
demanded Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e very faintly blushed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>"I mean that perhaps there may be some use for me‚Äîsomething
for me to do." She changed the subject by
adding: "And now it is time that Your Highness made
ready for the supper."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why should I go at his bidding?" cried Anne stormily.
"Why does he ask me to come? Merely to slight me
before these others, these rebellious Netherlanders he
gathers about him. God, what a life!" Her eyes sparkled
wildly, she clasped her hands on her knees and rocked
herself to and fro. "I had better have stayed in Saxony.
I was better treated there, more taken notice of‚Äîhere I am
nothing in my own household! What does he care? He
spends his time with other women, I will warrant."</p>

<p class='c000'>"His Highness spends his time in affairs, Madame, and
laborious business, and gives all his leisure to you," said
R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Affairs, business!" sneered Anne. "What do you
know of it? He will not attend Court because of this
foolish quarrel with the Cardinal; and as for his own matters,
if he attended to them he would not be in the confusion
and debt he is, with mortgages and money from the Jews.
Where does his fortune go?" she added, working herself
up. "I was a well-dowered maiden, but what I brought
him was like water thrown down a well. What have I
seen of it? His idle brothers and his mincing sisters bleed
him, I will swear."</p>

<p class='c000'>Her glance fell on the dress R√©n√®e had put out, and her
mood changed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps he is hoping that I shall not come down and
that he can roister alone with his worthless friends, but I
will disappoint him."</p>

<p class='c000'>This idea seemed to give her pleasure, and she suffered
two of her tire-women to array her in a gold and scarlet
brocade she was fond of, a wide ruff of Mechlin lace, and a
violet mantle with silver tissue. As she sat with an unusual
patience under the hands of the little German girl
who was crimping her hair with hot irons, she asked the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>reason of all the grey camlet liveries she had observed from
her window.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I note that many of the great lords' men wear them,"
she added.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, Madame," said the little maid, Katrine, glad that
her mistress was so quiet, "it is because of a dinner given
the other day by the Seigneur de Groblendonck, where the
talk fell on the extravagance of the Cardinal, and the great
splendour of his liveries; and it was agreed, to spite him,
that the grandees' men should all wear a plain livery, grey
camlet, as Your Highness saw it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"A pack of fools!" said Anne. "And was there no
protest?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"They say the first device on the sleeve was changed
from a Cardinal's hat to a bundle of arrows, at the Regent's
request; and she would have stopped the liveries, but there
were too many ordered and cut. It was the Count of
Egmont who thought of the design."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is a big fool," said Anne shrewdly. "Does he think
the King will ever forgive that? Who else was at this
dinner?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Seigneur Montigny and Seigneur Berghen and
others, Highness."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Silly child's jests!" cried the Princess. "Where did
you hear all this?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, Madame, one cannot stir without hearing it; the
town is full of the talk of it. If Your Highness had not
been indisposed," she added tactfully, "you too would
have heard of this dinner and the liveries."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne turned to R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why did you not tell me of this?" she demanded.
"It is much more interesting than your rhetoric plays."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The rhetoric play! I saw that!" cried little Katrine.
"I was with R√©n√®e‚Äîit was so amusing. There was a
fellow with chalk on his face made up like the Cardinal‚Äîand
some one called out to arrest him; but the people only
laughed, and when one of the town guard came up there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>was the Seigneur Brederode standing by the stage with his
sword half out and offering to spit anyone who touched
the players. And the guard made off, buffeted by the
crowd, who cheered my Lord Brederode finely‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You talk too much," said Anne crossly, "and you
have done my hair ill."</p>

<p class='c000'>She rose, fiercely pushing away the combs and brushes
that cumbered her dressing-table, and limped to the door,
a tragic enough figure in her ravaged and useless youth.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was R√©n√®e's duty to attend her to the dining-room,
for it pleased Anne to have a lady behind her chair as if
she was an Empress, and many and many a weary hour
had the waiting-woman spent observing the sulks, violences,
and rudenesses of Anne, and the unfailing gentleness of
the Prince‚Äîa gentleness which, however, was becoming
rather stern of late.</p>

<p class='c000'>To-night Anne received her guests with passable civility.
The brilliant saloon, the splendid dresses, the music, the
honour paid her, seemed to raise her spirits; but the effect
was only temporary. Half-way through the meal she fell
into sullenness; she clouted the ears of the page who
brought her napkin, and then, because he spilt some drops
of water on her gown, she screamed out for the music to
cease, saying the sound of it was tearing her head in two;
she abused the cooking, then sank into silence, emptying
glass after glass of wine.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e had noticed that the Princess drank far too much
of late; with the excuse of her headaches she always had
wine in her apartments, and the quantity of this she consumed
had considerably increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>And to-night the Prince observed it for himself; for
he moved his wife's glass away, and the steward, understanding,
brought no more wine to Her Highness. Anne
noticed this, and her eyes flamed with rage; she dragged
nervously at the tablecloth and pulled at her mouth.
R√©n√®e shuddered; she was somehow desperately desirous
that Anne should not shame the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>But the waiting-woman was powerless; she could only
stand there silent, a mere unnoticed spectator. It was a
brilliant company: Egmont was there with his wife,
Hoorne, Mansfeld, Montigny, Berghen, Brederode, and
other of the grandees and lesser nobles and their wives
now all openly banded against the Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the talk turned on the famous new liveries, and
Egmont described how he won the toss which was to decide
the design, and how eagerly his livery had been accepted.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this point Anne lifted her smouldering eyes and
turned to her husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Will our men appear in this beggarly camlet?" she
asked, and her tone was a direct insult to Egmont and
his fellows.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why not?" smiled William. "It will be an easy
means of economy, <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">ma mie</span></i>."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Economy!" repeated Anne scornfully. "That is a
strange point on which to begin economy; and is it not rather
late, too, now when your affairs stand almost past helping?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Her Highness speaks like a Cardinalist," smiled the
Countess of Egmont, in the hope of distracting Anne from
her temper. "Yet she must have little love for the persecutor
of the Protestants."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne leant forward, put her arm on the table, and stared
rudely at the Countess across the gold and silver, china and
porcelain of her own luxurious table.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I did not come to Brussels, Madame," she said, "to
bicker with the Cardinal and flout His Majesty, nay, nor
to live cooped away like a sick pigeon within four walls‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Anne!" said the Prince, turning in his chair. "Hush,
Anne."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Princess faced him with sudden frenzy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I may speak at my own table! I may say what I
wish! Do you think that I am Griselda in the silly tale
to suck my thumb patiently while you do what you please!
By the living God, I would that I was back in Saxony!
But little you care‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>"Anne!" cried William. "Oh, Anne!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Anne, Anne,'" she mocked him. "How long is Anne
to endure it?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The Countess of Egmont rose in her place and beckoned
to R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Her Highness is ill," she said quickly. "It is a shame
to expose her."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince caught at the words.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, you are ill‚Äîlet them see you to your chamber."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am not ill!" cried Anne, with a look of hate at the
Countess, "but heart-sick with the treatment I get."</p>

<p class='c000'>She rose too, glittering in her brocades and dragging
the cloth awry.</p>

<p class='c000'>"So I am to be sent from my own table," her railing
continued. She swayed on her feet and burst into hysteric
tears; the Prince caught her arm; she turned and struck
him feebly with her other hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Count Louis rose and clapped his hands, and the musicians
began to play, while R√©n√®e and the Prince led Anne from
the dining-hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they reached her room the little German girl came
running to meet them with a frightened face.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is the matter with her?" demanded William
sternly, as the sobbing, protesting Princess collapsed, a
shaken heap, on a chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>"She is ill," said R√©n√®e. She could not bear to look at
him, so pale he was, so suddenly grave and sad, all look of
youth gone from him. R√©n√®e felt personally shamed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A strange illness," he replied. "I can but hope that
she will improve as she becomes older."</p>

<p class='c000'>He was turning away when Katrine broke out‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness‚Äîit is the wine. To-night when I was
arranging the room I found these,"‚Äîshe pointed to a
dismal row of empty flasks on a side table,‚Äî"and the
steward told me he brought them to Madame‚Äîand
pounds of sugar. It is the wine which makes Her Highness
ill."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>R√©n√®e shuddered at the girl's boldness in thus unveiling
what the waiting-woman had concealed even from herself;
but perhaps, she thought desperately, it was as well that
the Prince should know.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is that it?" exclaimed the Prince; he flushed,
and his voice was full of an extraordinary bitterness.
He turned and looked at the intoxicated girl in her
disarrayed splendour and her imbecile tears. R√©n√®e
knew as well as if he spoke that he was thinking how
dear he had paid for this wedding, which he had so long
striven for, and so triumphantly achieved.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne struggled up, supporting herself on the arm of
the chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wish you had left me in Saxony," she sobbed
foolishly. "What life is this for me?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is not over-sweet for me, Madame," replied the
Prince. "But do not think that you can trouble me
further. I now know your worth, and can dismiss you
from my mind."</p>

<p class='c000'>She was frightened, half-sobered, for never before had
he spoken so coldly to her, and the finality of his tone
struck even her dazed brain, and she dimly realized that
she had lost him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This comes of all these miserable quarrels," she
muttered confusedly‚Äî"your livery‚Äîyour rhetoric
play‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is no need for a rhetoric play wherewith to
mock me," interrupted William. "Your Highness plays
a sorrier morality here than any mouthed in the streets."</p>

<p class='c000'>He left her; he went back to his guests. R√©n√®e and
Katrine, helped by another frightened woman, got the
Princess to bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>They then sat down, drearily enough, to their supper,
and conversed in whispers of Egmont's livery, their
mistress, the rhetoric play, and the things, big and small,
which went to make their life.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XI<br /> THE JESTERS AND THE RHETORIC PLAYERS</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>That winter the Count Adolphus, who had been
seeing service with the King of Denmark, joined
the Nassau household at Brussels, where Count
Louis was already living; he too hoped for some post
under his brilliant brother, and meanwhile eagerly joined
the party of the grandees and closely associated himself
with the band of young and reckless cavaliers, such as
Count Louis, Count Hoogstraaten, young Mansfeld, and
Henry Brederode.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a gorgeous life, an extravagant life, a life in
every way reckless and opulent that these seigneurs led
on the edge of revolution, on the edge of the King's
wrath, on the edge perhaps of worse things than any of
them dreamed.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were hunts, falcon parties, entertainments at
their magnificent country seats, balls, feasts, dinners,
masks in the great palaces in Brussels; even the
Cardinalists Aremberg, Aerschot, and Barlaymont mingled
in this joyous and spendthrift society. But it was the
party headed by Orange, Egmont, and Hoorne which
went the furthest in splendour, display, and open defiance
of the Cardinal and the edicts of the Inquisition‚Äîedicts
which two Stadtholders at least, Berghen and Montigny,
resolutely refused to enforce in their provinces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Granvelle smiled and wrote his long dispatches to the
King, carefully giving instances of the pride and insolence
of the grandees, and declaring that not only were they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>set against himself, but against the authority of His
Majesty. Margaret raged and wept and grew daily more
confused; all had forsaken her council board save the
Cardinal and his creatures, and her pride began to revolt
against Granvelle's obvious treatment of her as a puppet.
Her secretary Armenteros, one of the sly Spaniards bred
in the school of Madrid, urged her to assert herself, and
she could not but see that Granvelle's policy, however
acceptable to the King, was most likely to raise a religious
war in the Netherlands, which she, a foreigner in fact,
though nominally a Fleming, dared not attempt to coerce
without the aid of the Stadtholders with their immense
local influence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the new year it became secretly known to the
grandees that Margaret had lately sent a letter to the
King representing the desperate financial state of the
country, the firm hold heresy had, the immense feeling
against the Inquisition, the impossibility of counting on
the nobility while Granvelle remained in power, and the
advisability of recalling the Cardinal for a while.</p>

<p class='c000'>This news was received as a triumph, and Egmont,
with his usual recklessness, gave a great feast, where the
toast "to the departure of the man in red" was enthusiastically
drunk.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was past midnight when a party of young nobles‚ÄîAdolphus
of Nassau, Hoogstraaten, Montigny, and Brederode‚Äîleft
Egmont's mansion and turned homewards
through the moonlit streets of Brussels.</p>

<p class='c000'>They would not so soon have left the festival if they
had not been inspired by a project of daring mischief:
Brederode had a sheaf of violent pasquils under his
brocade cloak, Hoogstraaten in the same manner concealed
a pot of paste, and Adolphus and Montigny were
to keep watch while the other two placarded their insults
over any bare wall that offered.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a fair night, and the moonlight fell unclouded
into the streets, casting sharp shadows from gables and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>balconies and rendering the work of the young cavaliers
as dangerous as they could wish; even Egmont had
warned them against proceeding too far, and William
had perpetually forbidden his brothers to indulge in
dangerous jests, for William knew Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they were young, enthusiastic, warmed with wine,
absolutely fearless‚Äîand where Henry Brederode was
there could never be caution.</p>

<p class='c000'>This nobleman was not wealthy, but of as ancient a
descent as any in the Netherlands, being the last representative
of the former Counts of Holland, of whose vast
possessions, however, he retained only one lordship.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he stood now leaning against a church door on which
he was engaged in pasting his pasquil, it was easy to see the
fascination which kept him the friends of men who believed
him worthless, for there was a winning charm in the
handsome laughing face, the thick curls shading the bold
impudent eyes, the humorous mouth, showing the man of
ready wit, of endless daring, of quick temper, and ready
good nature. He was dressed, altogether beyond his
means, in purple and gold brocade; his ruff of Flanders lace
was stained with wine, and in the gold silk twist of his left
garter he carried a dagger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near him stood Anthony Lalaing, Count Hoogstraaten,
a chosen friend of the Prince of Orange despite his youth;
he was short and very slender, and looked almost like a
page as he offered the paste pot, his dark mantle wrapped
from his eyes to his knees, his hat pulled over his brow, the
only part of his festival attire visible being his rose-coloured
silk hose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adolphus of Nassau also muffled himself in his cloak,
and Floris de Montmorency, the Seigneur de Montigny, a
dark splendid cavalier, kept watch at the turn of the
street.</p>

<p class='c000'>The yellow lights of the two oil lamps, flickering before a
gaudy shrine to the Virgin set in the angle of the houses
opposite the church, showed that the streets were empty,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and that no one spied from the windows, alike all dark and
shuttered. But as Brederode, with a laugh of enjoyment,
was pasting a crude but effective likeness of the Cardinal
rapidly journeying to hell in the company of the Devil
next to the lampoon which he had already firmly affixed
to the church door, Hoogstraaten and Montigny both gave
a sound of warning‚Äîbut too late; a carriage, singularly
light and noiseless, swept round the corner, and the nobles,
whose own reckless laughter had concealed the sound of the
wheels, found the vehicle on them before they could fly.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of them, at least, did not wish to do so; Brederode
turned round, the paste-brush in his hand, ready for any
defiance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other three crowded close to the door, hiding with
their persons the distinct white squares of the still wet
lampoons.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What carriage in these streets at this hour?" whispered
Montigny, who, as the most prudent, was also the
most nervous and anxious.</p>

<p class='c000'>His curiosity was not long in being satisfied, the blinds
of the carriage were up, and from the window nearest the
church looked out the serene smooth face of Cardinal
Granvelle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even Brederode concealed the paste-brush, and the others
lowered their faces into the folds of their mantles.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the carriage stopped, and Granvelle looked straight
at Brederode.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Good evening," he said. "You enjoy the night air of
Brussels?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"As well on foot as Your Eminence in a carriage," replied
the Baron, throwing back his head, his eyes beginning to
dance with defiance.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, I," replied Granvelle, his glance travelling over the
other cavaliers‚Äî"I am returning to La Fontaine after
supper with the Regent."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I also am returning home," replied Brederode. "My
host was the Count Egmont."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>"Did the Count win any more dice throws?" asked the
Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay, we were not occupied in gaming," said Brederode;
"but had we played," he added, with his reckless loyalty to
Egmont, "I doubt not the Count would have won."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, he has luck," smiled the Cardinal, "but he may
find the throw of the dice that made him the designer of the
liveries a perilous victory."</p>

<p class='c000'>The three cavaliers drew closer together; for all their
high spirits and youthful bravado they knew what power
the Cardinal had with Philip, and what the King's wrath
meant. There might be eventual death for all of them if
Granvelle saw what was pasted on the church door behind
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Brederode answered dauntlessly‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is there not some peril in Your Eminence driving
abroad so late and unattended? Best be on your way;
you are not so popular in Brussels."</p>

<p class='c000'>Granvelle smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am well aware that I have enemies capable of assassinating
me, but I am able to despise them, even"‚Äîhis
glance again swept the silent three‚Äî"if these here are
among those willing to lie in wait to do me a mischief."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Whoever advised you so, lied!" cried Brederode.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cardinal leant farther from the window. "Who
are those behind you?" he asked. "Methinks I know the
figure of the Seigneur Hoogstraaten, or is it some page?
And a member of the House of Nassau‚Äîwould it be now‚ÄîAdolphus
or Louis?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Adolphus," answered that knight, who would not
involve his brother in his adventure; "and by your leave
we have as good right to be abroad as yourself."</p>

<p class='c000'>"An amorous adventure?" smiled Granvelle. "Yet a
church door is a strange rendezvous."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Eminence knows best of that," said Brederode,
with utter recklessness. "There are others beside you
who know how to reconcile love and the Church."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Granvelle was well-known to be far from saintly, and
the thrust caused him to wince. Adolphus caught Brederode's
sleeve and besought him to hush.</p>

<p class='c000'>"How many insolences go unchecked in the Netherlands!"
said Granvelle softly. "But the King is not
so easily mocked. Your names are all noted in Madrid."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Go there and remind His Majesty of them," answered
Brederode, "and place my name high on the list, and say
I sent you there to write it."</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoogstraaten pulled him back, and Montigny, disdaining
to be disguised now his companions were discovered,
moved forward, while Adolphus deftly set his back against
the placard.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Eminence will take no notice of the Count," he
said, "since he is obviously far gone in wine."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I take no notice of any of you," replied the Cardinal,
"and I think you are more drunk with treason than with
wine‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Treason?" shouted Brederode; "who dares give that
word to me?"</p>

<p class='c000'>And he was hurling himself on the Cardinal, but Hoogstraaten
and Adolphus held him back and forced him
against the wall; he laughed and broke loose from them,
disappearing in the shadows behind the Cardinal's carriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, Floris Montmorency," cried the Cardinal, "is this
the place for the Stadtholder of Hainault?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I but amuse myself with my companions," replied
Montigny, with a smile, though he was deeply conscious of
his false position.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The nobles of the Netherlands choose dangerous amusements,"
said the Cardinal, "and the Princes of Nassau
dangerous company," he added, glancing at Adolphus.</p>

<p class='c000'>The three nobles, bitterly irritated at the Cardinal's
questions and his delay, could hardly restrain their
impatience, especially as they suspected that he knew
well enough what they were about, and what they concealed
behind them on the church door.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>"You think I too dare something in reprimanding
you?" said Granvelle, "yet I cannot believe that the
chivalrous Houses of Nassau, Lalaing, and Montmorency
would combine against a defenceless priest."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Eminence need have no fear of that," replied
Montigny, "though we are not among those who have
found priests defenceless‚Äînay, very much the opposite."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The March air," replied Granvelle, "is too keen to
give a relish to this banter of wits with boys and
roysterers."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We wish no conversation with Your Eminence," cried
Adolphus angrily; "you might have driven on, for us,
without a word."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am sorry," said the Cardinal, with a keen look at
Montigny; "yea, I say again that I am sorry to see the
Stadtholder of Hainault in such company."</p>

<p class='c000'>With this remark, which Adolphus and Hoogstraaten
received as an insult and Montigny as a threat, Granvelle
signalled to the coachmen and leant back in his seat.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the carriage drove on up the slope, Montigny looked
anxiously for Brederode.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where is he? Fled?" Adolphus asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a shout of laughter answered them; the Count
was standing at the corner under the shrine and pointing
after the Cardinal's carriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the other three cavaliers looked in this direction
they could not forbear laughter either. On the back of
the carriage in which Granvelle was taking his stately
departure was pasted the lampoon and the picture of
His Eminence hastening along with the Devil.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the others had been using their wits, Brederode
had used his paste-brush, and to greater effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Par le Cordieu!</span>" cried the Count, "his face will turn
yellow when he sees that!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"But he will guess who did it, my Brederode," said
Hoogstraaten, "and what kind of exploit will that show
in us?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>"Give me the bills," added Montigny, "here is enough
for one night."</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoogstraaten cast his paste pot over the wall of the
garden nearest, and Adolphus was glad to end the
perilous jest; the night air, the conversation with the
Cardinal, had cleared their minds of the fumes of wine and
excitement. It had been a dangerous moment while they
stood with their backs against the placards on the church
door.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The news of this may reach Madrid," continued
Montigny, endeavouring to disarm Brederode of his brush.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Madrid is a great way off," returned the turbulent
Count.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But Philip has a long arm," said Montigny; he took
the rest of the pasquils from Brederode and thrust them
into his own doublet, and cast the brush over the wall
after the paste pot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brederode was inclined to be angry, till two of them
passed an arm in his, and the four of them went up the
street, the Count shouting a song loudly enough to bring
the solitary watch to the street corner as they went by.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had almost regained Egmont's palace, where
Hoogstraaten and Montigny were lodging, when their
progress was suddenly interrupted.</p>

<p class='c000'>A man stepped from a doorway and stood right across
the path of the four nobles. Their first thought was of
violence, and all of them clapped their hands on their
swords, but the fellow threw out his hands to show he
was defenceless, and then they noticed that he wore the
famous livery‚Äîthe camlet robe with the hanging sleeves
embroidered with the bunch of arrows.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is only one of you with his face uncovered,"
he said, in a low eager voice, "but he is the Seigneur
Brederode‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"At your service," said the Count; "whose fellow are
you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Alas, I am no one's fellow," was the reply; "this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>livery is but a disguise bought with my last ducats.
Titelmann is after me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Are you a heretic?" asked Montigny.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am nothing at all, but I played the part of the
Cardinal in the rhetoric play, and the bonnet maker
where I lodged betrayed me to the Inquisition. But the
boy of the house warned me, and I crept out and got
this habit, and have been in the streets ever since, and
if some great noble will not take me into his house,
Titelmann will get me at the last."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I like your humour," said Brederode instantly, "and
all enemies of the Cardinal are friends of mine‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>Montigny checked him and turned to the stranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Fellow," he demanded, "is this tale true, or but some
ruse? Answer me truthfully. I am the Stadtholder of
Hainault."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Before God it is true," answered the other earnestly.
"And I speak in dread of my life, and with no object
but to gain protection. Ever since it has been dark I
have been creeping from corner to corner, hoping to find
some seigneur‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Friend," interrupted Brederode, "I could take you
if my house was bigger and my debts less. But Egmont,"
he added, with his usual admiration of that nobleman,
"Egmont will give you shelter‚Äîhis house is as full of
heretics as Geneva itself."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then I will hasten to throw myself on the protection
of the noble Count," answered the other gratefully.
But Montigny, fearing the recklessness both of Brederode
and Egmont, was for seizing this stranger who might be
anything that he did not say he was‚Äîeven one of
Granvelle's spies‚Äîwhen Adolphus said, "Surely I know
his voice, his look‚Äî‚Äî" he dropped the mantle from his
face as he spoke, and gazed keenly at the other, who gave
a quick exclamation.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is the Count Adolphus of Nassau! Then out of
his princely goodness he can vouch for me." So saying,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>he thrust back the hood of his habit, revealing the smooth
keen face, the agate brown eyes, of Dupr√®s, the Elector
Augustus's skryer.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, it is he," said Adolphus, "who predicted a
bloody death for all of us. And now you are in fear of
death yourself," he added, with a smile; "it is strange that
one who can read the future cannot foretell his own perils."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Alas, noble seigneur," replied Dupr√®s, with his usual
mingled impudence and reverence, "the angels became
capricious and would not give me any more good advice,
and I, growing restless, must needs leave a good master
and go on my travels which have brought me here‚Äîand
will lead me no further than the stake unless one
of your princely Graces have pity on me. I have seen,"
he added, with a slight convulsive shudder, "men burning
who have beheld angels in the flames and died happy,
calling on Christ. But I have always been profane, and
am more like to see devils and die blaspheming my God."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We would deliver no one to death for such an offence
as yours," replied Montigny. "And since the Count
Adolphus knows you, he will take you to the household
of His Highness, where you will be sheltered."</p>

<p class='c000'>The skryer bent and impulsively kissed the young
knight's hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can he converse with angels?" demanded the
Count, who had kept silence so long with difficulty. "If
so he may bring them for me‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Alas, my magic table is lost," replied Dupr√®s, "and
the impression of the mystic seals‚Äîthey went down on
board ship, off Havre."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But you can tell my fortune?" persisted Brederode.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You will find that in the bottom of a wine cup, may
God forgive you!" cried Hoogstraaten, dragging him on.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, best go home before more befall us," said
Montigny, and the four parted‚ÄîBrederode and his two
friends back to the mansion of Egmont; and Adolphus,
with the skryer humbly behind him, to the Nassau palace.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII<br /> THE GRANDEES</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>The huge and lavish household of the Prince of
Orange, which included counts and barons, easily
afforded shelter to the poor skryer. William
listened to his story, gave him a place among his people,
and straightway forgot him.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Dupr√®s, after his late miserable adventures, was
sufficiently happy to find himself under this gorgeous
patronage; he had his room, his laboratory, his weekly
wage, and by means of the devices he had learned from
his late master, Vanderlinden, he earned many an odd
ducat from the numberless people who came and went in
the mansion of the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gained, too, a considerable dole from Anne, who was
overjoyed to see him again, and rejoiced at the diversion a
visit to his laboratory afforded. He worked on her childish
vanity with perfumes, soaps, lotions, cosmetics; and on
her idle credulity, by foretelling the future by means of
cards and mirrors; and with the ready wit and facile ability
which were his stock in trade, he speedily became a favourite
with the Princess, who was the only member of the household
sufficiently idle to be able to afford him limitless time,
patience, and encouragement; for Anne had no friends, and
she was not interested in her second child who lived apart
with nurses and maids.</p>

<p class='c000'>While William was becoming more and more absorbed
in the task of defeating Granvelle and the policies he stood
for, Anne was becoming more and more addicted to her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>fortune telling, her magic experiments, her wine drinking,
and her bouts of fury, which rendered it almost impossible
to find any one to wait on her. Only R√©n√®e le Meung
remained at her task, patient, impassive, serving her
mistress with as much devotion as if she loved her, concealing
her faults as much as possible, and doing all in her
power to make Anne preserve a reputable appearance
before her world. It was a thankless, bitter task, but R√©n√®e
performed it with as complete a self-abnegation as any
anchorite his daily round of prayers and penances.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne had drifted completely from her husband, the passionate
affection she had once evinced for him never revived
in one single moment of tenderness. His quarrel with
Granvelle, which had closed the Regent's Court to her, his
absorption in affairs in which she refused to take the
slightest interest, and the neglect she fancied she had
received from all in Brussels, had produced in Anne a
bitter disappointment from which grew an equally bitter
dislike of her husband whom she regarded as the author
of these evils.</p>

<p class='c000'>But William, eminently generous, peace-loving, and used
to domestic gentleness and serenity, made more than one
attempt to restore amity; Anne's character bewildered
and confused him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after he had received the momentous news that
Cardinal Granvelle had requested the Regent's permission
to accompany his brother for a few days into Burgundy
to visit their mother, and that Egmont's offer to go to
Madrid and explain the affairs of the Provinces in person
had been declined, and that the King's answer to the
petitions of Orange, Egmont, and Hoorne to remove the
Cardinal had been a dry and stiff note bidding the three
once more take their places at the Regent's table, William
summoned a meeting of all the grandees who had leagued
with him against the Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince was serious that day; he was often serious
lately; matters in the Netherlands became daily worse.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>The daily sight of the horrible executions of the Inquisition
were driving the people to frenzy, the estates and cities
were protesting against the abuse of their charters, and
Margaret was helpless. She advised moderation, she
promised moderation, but she did not enforce it, for
Inquisitor Titelmann was daily in her antechamber, and
she was as afraid of Peter Titelmann as she was afraid of
Granvelle and of Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the Prince of Orange, looking about him, beheld
confusion, tumult, mystery, danger, and blood; the sky
was dark, the air heavy with menaces, and to his acute
ear an even more deadly sound was discernible‚Äîthe first
low roll of drums beating up for war. The day of the
gathering of the grandees, passing through a little cabinet
on his way to the chamber where he was to meet them, he
unexpectedly saw his wife, leaning on her side in the window-seat,
arranging strange Eastern cards in fantastic patterns.</p>

<p class='c000'>Behind her a glory of coloured glass cast blue and
crimson and gold light over the smooth panelled-wood
walls of the little room, over the bent figure of the Princess
in her trailing, untidy gown of white and black Venetian
velvet, and over the crudely coloured and grotesquely
pictured faces of the cards she was arranging with such care.</p>

<p class='c000'>On a stool near her, but out of the stream of light, sat
R√©n√®e, her brown dress scarcely distinguishable from
the panelling and the shadows, but her fair face, her vivid
hair, brilliant above the plain linen of her small ruff.</p>

<p class='c000'>William paused on seeing the two women. Anne glanced
up and then down again without saying a word; R√©n√®e rose
and curtsied. The Prince hesitated a moment, then crossed
to his wife and laid his hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Ma mie</span></i>," he said gently, "what occupation is this for
you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am telling my fortune," returned Anne, "in the hope
that the future may be fairer than the past; I am telling
little Anne's fortune, in the hope it may be better than
mine."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>"Why in this public place?" asked the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne violently threw down the two cards she held and
rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Because I am tired of my rooms! I am tired of
everything! Why do you interfere in my movements?"</p>

<p class='c000'>William caught her small, hot, and feeble hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If you would live more in accord with me I could
make life sweeter for you," he said almost wistfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>She stood sullenly, looking away.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Listen, Anne," he continued, "it means much to any
man who has difficult affairs on his shoulders to know his
wife is bearing her part with patience and discretion‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, now you are preaching, like my Uncles Augustus
and William," cried the Princess fiercely, "and that,
princely Highness, is what I would never endure."</p>

<p class='c000'>She swept all the cards savagely from the window-seat
to the floor and turned away; the Prince's anger was
checked by the sight of the limp that marred her walk
and impeded her haste to be gone from him.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e began picking up the cards; the light fell over
her now, glorifying her opulent beauty that neither her
plain dress nor her own cold indifference could eclipse.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where is the Princess going?" asked William.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think she will go to the workshop of her alchemist, as
she calls Dupr√®s, the Burgundian whom Your Highness is
sheltering."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince looked keenly at this fair woman who might
have so easily been brilliant and who was so extraordinarily
passive and so unnaturally patient; it was not the first
time he had noticed her utter self-effacement.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Child," he said kindly, "I fear your service is a dull
one and your mistress difficult."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I hope for nothing better, Your Highness," replied
R√©n√®e quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are very pretty to be so meek," smiled William.</p>

<p class='c000'>The warm colour rushed to the waiting-woman's face; she
stood looking down at the gathered cards in her hands.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>"Her Highness keeps me out of charity," she said;
"my father was slain as a heretic‚Äîwe lost everything.
I am quite friendless, and quite penniless, but for Her
Highness."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am sorry," replied the Prince gently; "but do not
speak of charity‚Äîand what you gain is hardly earned. I
have marked that. What were your estates?"</p>

<p class='c000'>She named them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They were confiscated by the Inquisition," she added.</p>

<p class='c000'>William sighed, well knowing that such property was
impossible of recovery.</p>

<p class='c000'>"When you find your husband I will dower you," he
said.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e lifted her face; he could not understand the look on
it which almost startled him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I thank Your Highness," she said. "Shall I now attend
the Princess?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, keep with her," returned the Prince. He was
turning away when he added, "Whom does she meet in
this workshop?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Very few, Highness; sometimes there is there a certain
Rubens, a lawyer, and his wife, who are friends of Dupr√®s."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is not company for the Princess of Orange," said
the Prince. He frowned, hesitated; then turned sharply
away.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e stood still a moment, the rose colour glowing in her
face, then went in search of Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Princess was not in Dupr√®s' laboratory; the
waiting-woman found her in her room, sunk in the apathy
that was the usual result of her fits of passion.</p>

<p class='c000'>She sullenly bade R√©n√®e leave her alone, and that lady
turned away, idleness and the whole afternoon before her.
Katrine had already slipped out into the garden to meet
some cavalier, the other women each had her own duty or
her leisure; there was no company for R√©n√®e. She went
out into the beautiful galleries, empty for once, and turned
rapidly towards the hall where the Prince was to meet the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>grandees. It was one of the principal chambers of the
mansion, and had a large musician's gallery from which
R√©n√®e and the other waiting-women and pages often
watched the balls, masques, and feasts going on below.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e now tried the little door leading to the private
staircase of the gallery‚Äîit was unlocked; the meeting was
no secret, and precautions against eavesdroppers had not
been taken. With a heart strangely beating, R√©n√®e mounted
the little dark stair and came softly out into the gallery
which was shadowed and partly concealed by long crimson
brocade curtains stitched and fringed with black.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sheltered by the heavy folds, the waiting-woman peeped
down into the hall glowing from the light of a great fire
which flamed up the huge chimney, and sparkling from the
winter sunlight pouring through the coloured glass of the
high long windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the walls hung tapestries of silk run with gleams of
bullion: they represented the story of Medea and Jason.</p>

<p class='c000'>Against the brilliant background were grouped all the
grandees and nobles who were leagued against the Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e's glance went eagerly from one to the other. There
was Egmont in a camlet doublet with hanging sleeves embroidered
with a bunch of arrows, in imitation of his famous
livery; there was Hoorne, aloof, silent, gloomy, disliking his
company only less than he disliked the Cardinal; there was
Montigny, young Mansfeld, and Hoogstraaten, gorgeous
young knights in brocade and silk; the two graceful younger
Nassau Counts; the Marquis Berghen, heavy and corpulent;
Brederode; the Seigneur de Glayon; Meghem, alert and
warlike; and William of Orange, the man who was the
acknowledged leader and centre of these Netherland
Seigneurs and Stadtholders.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was leaning over the high back of a gilt leather chair,
talking earnestly of the instances of the atrocities of the
Inquisitors which had come to his ears, and of the necessity
for resisting them and their protector, Granvelle, to the
utmost.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>"Granvelle has asked for leave to go to Burgundy," he
finished. "From secret information I believe he has asked
for leave on Philip's advice, but, be that as it may, it must
be our charge to see that once he has left the Netherlands
he does not return."</p>

<p class='c000'>He ceased speaking, but did not move from his easy
yet thoughtful attitude while the groups about him broke
into animated speech, while above all could be heard the
voice of Brederode offering to wring Granvelle's neck if
ever he should again set foot in the Netherlands once he had
left them.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e gazed at William as he stood quietly observing
the others, his dark face resting on his slim brown hand,
a confusion of gold and crimson light falling over his
slender figure; she noted the violet sheen of his Sicilian
brocade, and the stiff points of the openwork double ruff
which encircled his small well-shaped head.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e remembered how she had first seen him coming
up the stairs of the town hall of Leipsic to greet his bride,
and how, on the evening of his wedding day, she had looked
down from a gallery on him, as she was looking now, and
seen him move through the slow figures of the dance and sit
beside Anne on the gold couch while the mummers brought
them lilies and sweetmeats.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e had long since reversed her first judgment of the
Prince. She no longer thought him an idle extravagant
courtier, she had seen him proved brave, able, resolute; she
knew that he set his face against the tyranny which put
the Netherlands under the Inquisition, and now she heard
him speak for liberty of conscience, for tolerance, for justice
for the heretics‚Äîthose poor creatures about whom great
nobles usually concerned themselves not at all.</p>

<p class='c000'><em>He</em> cared, however; she had heard him speak in a moved
voice of Titelmann's burnings and slayings; she had heard
him dare to declare that these things should not be.</p>

<p class='c000'>She found that she believed in him‚Äîstrangely, intensely
believed in him; it seemed to her that he was only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>half-revealed even to these men about him, that there was
a part of him as yet known to no one, and that he had
qualities which had never been guessed. She believed he
would go further than he said, do more than he promised,
be indeed a buckler and a shield, a light and a sword, to her
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>She drew completely back behind the curtains and put
her shuddering hands before her face. She knew now why
she had stayed with Anne, enduring everything; it was
because of him, because she wanted to serve him, to hear
of him, to be near him, because she thought he was the
hero whom she had despaired to find, because she loved
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Erect and motionless she stood, hearing his voice again
as he spoke to his friends‚Äîthe voice and tone of a self-reliant
man, but one who eagerly wants sympathy, who
almost wistfully asks for trust and belief. R√©n√®e had
noticed before this gentleness of the strong nature, this
affectionate friendliness of the astute wit, and they were
to her eminently lovable traits, for by his gentleness she
judged his strength‚Äîthat greatest strength that is ever
allied with sweetness.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she stood there hidden, listening to his voice, the
strangeness of life smote her almost intolerably. He was
a great Prince who would never notice her save with that
kindness of utter indifference which he would show to any
of his servants; there was she, helpless to serve him, bound
to eternal abnegation yet dedicated to him with her whole
untouched heart and soul; and there was Anne, his wife,
to whom he turned for companionship and sympathy,
repulsing him fiercely, almost hating him, preferring the
society of Dupr√®s, the charlatan, or to drink herself stupid
in her chamber rather than share any of his aims and cares.</p>

<p class='c000'>And to keep her from utter degradation, to soften her
furies, to coax her good humour, to excuse her, to put the
best of her forward and conceal the worst, that was the
only service R√©n√®e could render the Prince‚Äîa little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>thankless service, one that would be never rewarded, not
even noticed in its true worth, yet she was glad to do it
for this man who was standing for her country and her
religion, this man whom she loved.</p>

<p class='c000'>She heard the grandees leaving‚Äîtheir pleasant voices,
the mingled footsteps, the opening and closing of the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>When silence fell she looked again over the edge of the
balcony.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince was alone, seated by the fire, his head
bent; by his side was a pretty little white hunting dog,
and William's right hand absently caressed its long ears.</p>

<p class='c000'>His face was in profile to R√©n√®e, and the firelight played
over the fine lines of it, the low forehead, the straight nose,
the firm mouth and chin, the compact head with the dark
close hair; he was slightly frowning, and his brows were
drawn over his eyes usually so wide open and vivacious.</p>

<p class='c000'>In refinement, precision of outline, exactness of proportion,
and expression both of elegance and force, he looked
that perfect type, at once intellectual and athletic, which
the ancients gave to their heroes‚Äîa type so removed from
coarseness or grossness as to appear almost delicate, yet
in reality strong with the supreme strength of a brain
perfectly adjusted and a mind perfectly balanced and a
body admirably made.</p>

<p class='c000'>The twilight began to enter the sombre, magnificent
chamber, and all the colours of glass windows, rich furniture,
brilliant tapestry were blended into one deep glowing
shadow, in the midst of which the dying ruby gleam of the
fire brought out the figure of the Prince in his gorgeous
brocades, his thoughtful face now serene as a fine mask,
leaning back in his gilt chair and gazing in the flames, so
wholly unconscious of that loving spectator who watched
him so breathlessly from the gallery.</p>

<p class='c000'>At last she moved away, quietly through the shadows,
down the dark stairs and back to her duty. Anne was in
her usual place by the stove, drinking sugared beer, and
little Katrine was moving about the room sobbing under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>her breath with a great red mark on her face where her
mistress had slapped her for being late.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e whispered to the girl to go away, and herself
commenced the duties of putting in order all the Princess's
disarranged things.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne began railing at her in a voice broken with tears;
the waiting-woman hardly heard, for in her ears were the
words she had just heard the Prince speak, and before her
eyes the picture of him in the twilight, alone and thoughtful.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> THE DEPARTURE OF THE CARDINAL</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Cardinal Granvelle had asked and obtained
leave to go to Burgundy to see his mother, whom he
had not beheld for nineteen years.</p>

<p class='c000'>That was now common knowledge, and a tumult of
rejoicing broke forth which frightened the Regent almost
more than the tumult of rage and hate which had preceded
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>For it seemed as if the people believed that with the
departure of the Cardinal all their wrongs and miseries
would end and the golden age begin; pamphlets, lampoons,
caricatures, issued in hundreds from the secret printing
presses, were scattered in the streets, pasted on the
walls of the churches, and found their way even to Granvelle's
cabinet and Margaret's antechamber; the rhetoric
players became daily bolder and performed their satirical
plays before huge audiences who forcibly protected the
actors; heretic preachers addressed their followers even
from the pulpits of churches from which the priests had
been driven, and two of them, condemned to the flames
by the Inquisition at Antwerp, were rescued, even after
they had been chained to the stake, by the furious people,
who carried them back in triumph to their lodgings.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it was not only the people who thus recklessly
displayed their joy at the departure of the hated minister.
The victorious nobles, particularly Egmont and Brederode,
openly exulted in the downfall of their enemy, for none
of them believed that the object of his visit was more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>an excuse, and it was generally thought that his journey
to Burgundy was a mere pretext for retiring with dignity
from a position he could no longer maintain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Various rumours were abroad: some said the Cardinal
had asked to be removed from the Netherlands, others that
he was obeying secret orders from Philip and was furious
at leaving the contest with the grandees, but whichever
of their surmises might be correct it was certain that he
was leaving and almost as sure that he would not return.
Already a wit had pasted a notice "to be sold" over his
villa "La Fontaine," and much laughter was provoked
by the famous statue with "<em>Durate</em>" on the pedestal,
which word had a mocking sound now.</p>

<p class='c000'>But through all this hearty, intense, noisy rejoicing of
the Netherlanders the Cardinal remained serene. Perhaps
what gave him his calm was his knowledge of the other
side of the picture; he knew Madrid, he knew Philip;
he knew too how all this present rejoicing would be
paid for some day, how Philip had marked and noted the
names of these gay nobles who had driven out his minister,
how all the reckless jests, pasquinades and speeches, the
famous insolence of Egmont's livery, the disloyalty of
Berghen and Montigny, were all known to Philip, and
by him patiently and painstakingly noted down. Philip
knew how to wait, but he had a memory no detail escaped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Granvelle was not vindictive, and he was too politic to be
inclement; he had no desire to be avenged on the men
who had caused his downfall, and his last words to the
Regent were to advise her to overlook the present disorders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed he disdained all his opponents save one only, the
Prince of Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw that without him the other nobles would be
nothing; he was the guiding spirit of Egmont and Hoorne,
neither of whom could have stood alone, and the first of
whom, at least, would easily have been won by the Cardinal
but for Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is a dangerous man," said Granvelle with admiration,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>and loyally warned his master; then, with an unruffled
spirit and a smile for all, set out on his journey to Burgundy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brussels seethed with excitement and joy; the members
of the great trade guilds, the armourers, the cloth makers,
the glovers, the gardeners, turned out in bands and paraded
the streets; many of the shops closed while the servers and
apprentices went out to see the Cardinal pass; parties of
Protestants went about singing the hymns of Marot, and
defying the law. It was a general holiday, and the only
people angry and discomfited were the Cardinalists, Barlaymont,
Aerschot, and Vigilius, who saw their power at an end;
even the Regent was glad to see Granvelle go, for she hoped
and imagined that the seigneurs would be easier to manage
than the astute and able priest.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Poor Madame Parma," remarked the Cardinal to his
brother, the Seigneur de Chantonnay, who accompanied
him in his carriage, "she cannot manage her charge at
all. His Majesty should send a man to the Netherlands."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Duke of Alva for example," replied Chantonnay,
who hated the Netherlanders.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Alva is too severe," returned Granvelle; "these are
people who will not bear too light a curb, too heavy a yoke.
Alva has already recommended the taking off of the heads
of Egmont and Hoorne."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why not?" said the other, who was vexed at his
brother's fall and extremely irritated by the joyous and
insolent farewells being given to the cavalcade as it passed
towards the gates. "They are little better than rebels."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Egmont is more useful to His Majesty alive than dead‚Äîbetter
buy him than behead him."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is he to be bought?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Easily‚Äîpoor, extravagant, vain‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"But he is under the influence of Orange," said Chantonnay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Granvelle smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There you have the crux of the situation, my friend,"
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>he replied. "The Prince of Orange. That is the man to
strike, the others are boys and roysterers‚Äîbut he knows
how to use them. If it had not been for him I should not
be leaving the Netherlands now."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why is he so disloyal?" asked Chantonnay peevishly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, who knows what game he plays!" replied the
Cardinal rather wearily. "He is serving neither King nor
Church, so he must be serving himself‚Äîambition!"</p>

<p class='c000'>They had now nearly reached the gates of Caudenberg,
and the Cardinal's escort, princely train and numerous
equipages, were blocked for a moment by the narrowness
of the streets and the pressure of the exulting crowds.
Chantonnay was afraid of violence, even of assassination;
there had been rumours of hired murderers lying in wait
for the Cardinal, ready to take the first opportunity of
attack; but Granvelle, who had driven alone and unarmed
at night out to his country residence, was not to be
frightened now, though the crowd might very well be
dangerous.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked steadily and keenly out of the coach window
at the faces of his enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They are sturdy people," he remarked, "who will give
the King much trouble. And what truly grieves me is to
see what little respect there is for holy things, one might
say that there is no religion left in the land."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yet the great nobles have taken the Cardinal's Hat from
the livery, I observe," said Chantonnay, "and put instead
a bunch of arrows."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Duchess requested it," returned the Cardinal, who
was still intently observing the crowd. "But what helps
that? The Hat but meant insult to me and God's poor
priests, whereas the arrows mean that they are banded
together against the King, which is a declaration of rebellion
no monarch should endure."</p>

<p class='c000'>The carriage now moved on, and the Cardinal leant back
in his seat; he had been looking to see if any of the nobles
were among the crowd, for he wished to report very exactly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>the behaviour of these seigneurs to Philip. So far he had
noticed none above the baser sort, but presently, as they
neared the gate, he looked out again and up at the house near
by where he knew Brederode had his lodgings.</p>

<p class='c000'>And there at one of the windows was the Count together
with the Count Hoogstraaten, the two of them laughing
and throwing up their caps and clapping their hands in undisguised
triumph and delight. This boyish exultation
brought to Granvelle's cheek the angry flush the stately
victory of William of Orange had failed to evoke; the
brilliant minister, the skilful politician, the haughty priest
tasted humiliation when he saw himself the butt of the
malicious wits of these two young cavaliers.</p>

<p class='c000'>He drew into the farthest corner of the carriage, but they
had seen him, and, leaning out of the window, shouted their
farewells with redoubled pleasure as the procession finally
passed through the gates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, with the common impulse not to let their defeated
enemy escape too cheaply, they rushed down to the courtyard.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I must see the last of the old fox!" cried Hoogstraaten,
and he flung himself on his horse which stood waiting for
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I too!" laughed Brederode, "and as I am not booted
I will come with you."</p>

<p class='c000'>So saying he leapt on the Count's croup, and they dashed
through street and gates in pursuit of the Cardinal's stately
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cort√©ge</span>, which was attended by a number of sumpter-mules,
lent him by the Duchess.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two knights on the one horse, Hoogstraaten in his
buff and gold riding suit, his black velvet cap with the long
heron's feather fastened by an emerald, his violet mantle;
Brederode in the tawny damask satin, Flanders lace,
scarlet points, and silk hose, in which he had danced nearly
all through the night, were at once recognized by the crowd
and cheered and applauded as heartily as the Cardinal had
been hissed and execrated.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Brederode gaily waved the mantle he had snatched up as
a pretence at a disguise, and laughed over the edge of his
triple ruff which was something broken and something
stained, and the couple plunged through the gates and out
on to the road where the Cardinal was commencing his
stately, if tedious, progress towards Namur, the first stage
of the journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were several others following the cavalcade,
notably one of Egmont's gentlemen, and one who was in
the employ of the Marquis Berghen, that nobleman whom
the Cardinal disliked and feared next to the Prince of Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there was no representative of the House of Nassau
dogging the retreat of His Eminence, and William would
have been far from pleased had he known of the exploit
of Hoogstraaten and Brederode.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a while these two cavaliers kept a discreet distance
from the Cardinal, and remained at the side of the road
in the rear and near to the baggage mules.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this did not long satisfy Brederode; he wished
to ride by Granvelle's actual carriage, and to let him see
who was escorting him on his journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so, when the road fell into a little ravine, the two
cavaliers rode along the edge of the height until they
were beside the carriage and could look down on it, and
when the way was level again they reappeared at the
edge of the autumn forest, near enough to His Eminence's
coach to look in at the window.</p>

<p class='c000'>Granvelle's attention was attracted by Chantonnay to
this spectacle of two men on one horse, and he looked
out of the carriage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoogstraaten had thrown his mantle over the lower
part of his face, but Brederode's reckless face was uncovered
save for the brown curls the March wind blew
across his brow and cheeks (for he was hatless).</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cardinal knew both instantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They are buffoons," he remarked, but though he
tried thus to dismiss the incident, it vexed him; however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>the annoyance passed when he reflected how dearly the
jesters were likely to pay for their jest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two cavaliers, regardless of the fact that the Cardinal
had seen them and that therefore a full account of their
exploit was certain to reach Philip, continued to follow
the cavalcade in its slow progress over the rough, muddy
winter roads until they reached a high piece of rising
ground that commanded a full view of the surrounding
country‚Äîbare woods, fields, hedges, disappearing into
the cold blue mist of the distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here they waited, and looking scornfully down on the
Cardinal's coach as it passed, watched it lumbering along
the road to Namur until a turn hid it from their eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"At the first stage Granvelle will write of this to the
Duchess," remarked Hoogstraaten, in a grave voice;
his high spirits had left him, his prudence, though not
his courage, was alarmed at what he had done.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Brederode laughed; prudence was as unknown to
him as fear; he had a far better claim than Philip to the
Countship of all Holland, for his ancestry went unbrokenly
back five hundred years to the ancient sovereigns of that
province. In his heart he regarded the King as a usurper,
and he had no respect either for him or his ministers;
indeed, his furious loathing of Granvelle and his policies
was based on his hatred of seeing his native land, where
his forebears had ruled, in the hands of foreigners.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, we have seen the last flick of the fox's tail,"
he said joyously, "and now we may go home to dinner,
this keen air has given me an appetite."</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoogstraaten turned the horse's head towards Brussels.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, the Cardinal has gone, but his disciples remain,"
he answered thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The seigneurs will see to them," said Brederode
confidently.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, I know not," remarked Hoogstraaten; "I believe
Armenteros, the Regent's secretary, has more influence
with her than Orange himself. But we shall see."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>"Ay, we shall see, my Anthony," returned Brederode,
"for my part I do not think so gloomily; if Armenteros
behave as Granvelle has, then he may follow the same
road‚Äîwe have cast down a Cardinal, do you think we
are to be baffled by a clerk?"</p>

<p class='c000'>And he began to sing a cheerful song in a merry bass
voice which rose very pleasantly over the still winter
woodlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they reached the Caudenberg gate they
found the city still full of joyous emotion, and received
as noisy a greeting as they had done on their departure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoogstraaten would have dismounted at Brederode's
lodgings, but that nobleman would by no means permit
it, and they continued their progress through the city,
exchanging joyful congratulations and greetings with
those who were making a festival of Granvelle's departure.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they made their way up the high streets which led
to the ancient Brabant palace which was the Regent's
residence, they were hailed by a half-laughing voice,
and the Prince of Orange galloped alongside them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have escorted His Eminence on the road to
Namur!" cried Brederode.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And though hungry and thirsty and cold," added
Hoogstraaten, "we are now joining in the rejoicings of
the good citizens."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, seigneurs," said William, with a little smile,
"one day your pleasantries will end in a mischief, I
fear."</p>

<p class='c000'>"To our enemies, yes," replied Brederode. "Where
is Your Highness going?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"To wait on the Regent."</p>

<p class='c000'>"So soon?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ay, Margaret having flung away one prop must
seize another; she is a weak woman and cannot stand
alone," remarked Hoogstraaten.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Shall we see you at supper to-night?" asked
Brederode, as the Prince touched up his horse.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>"Nay," smiled the Prince, "a wise man avoids your
suppers, my Brederode, at least when he has business to
perform."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have an excellent cook," pleaded the Count.</p>

<p class='c000'>William, still smiling, shook his head and rode on
towards the Brabant palace.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went slowly, without parade or a single attendant,
greeted affectionately and loyally by most of the people,
for though some were doubtful of his attitude, the bulk
believed that he would defend their liberties, and a great
number even of the heretics had their hope in the great
Catholic Prince who had already spoken against the
Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c000'>To-day, too, he was regarded by the people with added
respect and interest, for it was clear that now the Cardinal
had fallen, the Prince, as the principal member of the
league that had brought about Granvelle's downfall,
would be the greatest man in the Netherlands. Many
wistful eyes were turned towards him as he rode, for
many felt their fate was in his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>His deportment was not that of a man either triumphant
or joyous; he was pale beneath the clear brown of his
proper complexion, his eyes were guarded and thoughtful,
and though he smiled with his usual pleasantness at
those of his acquaintances he met, his manner was absent,
and he seemed neither so gay nor so careless as he had
done even a few days before.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he reached the Brabant palace he met Egmont
leaving the gates; the Count was flushed with pleasure
at the reception the Regent had given him, and loud in
his protestations of loyalty to Church and King; he
was disposed to be frank and generous in his triumphs,
and to heartily forgive all his enemies now the chief of
them had been removed.</p>

<p class='c000'>William regarded him affectionately, but said very
little, and his air was still grave as he entered the palace.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> THE REGENT, THE PRINCE, AND THE<br /> CARDINALIST</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Margaret received William warmly; she already
spoke of the Cardinal with dislike and vexation,
declared herself rejoiced to be rid of him, and showed
every intention of flattering the men who had replaced
him and his party and who must henceforth be supreme
in her councils.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Prince was not captured by these compliments
as Egmont had been; he had his agents at the Spanish
Court, he knew something of the other side of the picture,
and while Margaret was speaking he was looking at
Armenteros, the arrogant Spanish secretary, who remained
in the chamber. In this man, known to be deep in Philip's
confidence and intimate with the Duchess, William beheld
Granvelle's true successor.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time he was perfectly well aware that
Margaret knew his great influence, his unique position,
and was sincerely desirous of attaching him to her; indeed,
it was quite clear to the Prince that the Regent, despite her
haughtiness, her pose of firmness, and independence, was
sorely bewildered and confused how to manage her perilous
wardship of the Netherlands, and eager enough for help
and counsel.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Prince was not the man to sympathize with an
arrogant woman unequal to her charge; he deemed a woman
as out of place in government as a man at a spinning-wheel,
though one who was queen by right and not by choice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>would have had his deep loyalty, but Margaret, however,
was practically a foreigner, and lording in a place not
her own, and neither the character of this woman who
assumed such masculine qualities and was in reality so
weak and futile, nor the rank of this Princess whose mother
had been the daughter of a poor weaver of Oudenarde,
could inspire any respect or admiration in the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>He considered her as but a poor instrument of Philip's
policy, and even while she was offering him the courtesies
she thought so diplomatic, he was wondering how long she
would hold her place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret on her side was uneasy; she could not read
the Prince, she did not wholly trust him, yet she knew
him to be necessary to her. With Egmont she had felt
far safer; whatever his extravagances he was obviously
loyal, obviously a good Catholic, and she was sure of the
Prince on neither of these points; indeed, the painstaking
Regent, sincerely eager to do her duty towards Philip and
the Church, was secretly sorely puzzled how to deal with
William.</p>

<p class='c000'>She proceeded to endeavour to win, and if possible,
deceive him by cajoleries and blandishments, as she had
already won and deceived Egmont, for her politics were
those of Machiavelli and Loyola.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now the Cardinal has gone," she said, "I can surround
myself with my good friends whom he kept from me, and
I hope all will go more smoothly and prosperously, both
in my councils and the states, without this meddling
priest."</p>

<p class='c000'>William smiled into his ruff; by her abuse of Granvelle
he could measure what she had said of him to the
Cardinal, what she would, most likely, be writing to that
minister within a few hours.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There will be more prosperity for His Majesty's subjects
and less anxiety for those who serve His Majesty,
if His Eminence's counsels are reversed," he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret regarded him with an anxiety she could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>altogether conceal; her full bosom heaved beneath the
gathered lawn and the Genoa velvet, and a quiver passed
over her majestic face which she endeavoured to keep so
regally impassive.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is to be supposed his policies are to be reversed,
Highness," she answered, "since his enemies will take his
place;" then remembering that the Cardinal's absence
was supposed to be only a temporary one, "It may be some
while before he returns to the Netherlands, and meanwhile
we need not consult him," she added.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Will he return at all?" smiled William, looking
straightly at her. "I scarcely think so, Madame."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duchess, who had had Philip's secret instructions
to allow the Cardinal to depart, and who knew that the
visit to Burgundy was an elaborate ruse to disguise the
downfall of the minister, was startled at the Prince's words.
"How much does he know?" she thought, and her respect
and awe of him increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Cardinal's return must be in His Majesty's good
pleasure," she replied, smiling in her turn. "Meanwhile
we have other things to think of. I have asked Your
Highness here, to this private audience, because I know you
to be of a nature as noble as your rank, and because I want
you to aid and support me in the task I have before me,
which is not, the Virgin help me, a light one."</p>

<p class='c000'>Behind the obvious flattery of the words was a sincere
feminine appeal for help, and her eyes were turned on the
Prince with a real anxiety.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Surely, Madame," replied William, "you do not think
I should be disloyal to you? I know I have been greatly
slandered, but I trust you have never believed disloyalty of
me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay, nay," said Margaret. "I did not even think
of disloyalty‚Äîbut I have had to complain, with justice,
that you have so obstinately kept aloof from my councils."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Because my presence was useless where no one was
listened to save Granvelle and his creatures, Madame."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>"That is over," replied the Duchess, "and now I rely
on the seigneurs and principally on Your Highness."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I hope to deserve the trust," said William, "and to
advise Your Grace for the peace and welfare of the States."</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret felt the words formal; she perceived that he
could play with phrases as well as she, and that she was
unlikely to gain much from him this way. While she was
turning over in her mind the best way to gain him, William
spoke again, using a frankness that was more subtle and
more baffling than all Margaret's tortuous methods and
policies.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Excellency will not enforce the Inquisition?"
he asked, he was looking at Margaret, but he noted the
little movement the silent secretary made at his words.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have recommended mercy and gentleness to Peter
Titelmann," replied the Regent, "and I ever beg His
Majesty to use clemency towards the Netherlands."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But you will enforce the Inquisition?" persisted the
Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It cannot be supposed," answered Margaret suavely,
"that the King will endure heresy among his subjects."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is then his intention to extirpate heresy?" asked
William, and he remembered that conversation with Henry
of France in the woods of Vincennes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"An intention known to all the world," asserted
Margaret. "His Majesty would rather lose his kingdoms
than endure that heresy should flourish under his rule."</p>

<p class='c000'>They were almost the same words that Granvelle had
used in the gardens of La Fontaine.</p>

<p class='c000'>"None the less," added Margaret, "His Majesty awaits
the decision of the Council of Trent before proceeding
severely against these wretches."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Meanwhile," said William, "the Inquisitors are
burning, strangling, torturing in every town in the States."</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret flushed angrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Those who are thus punished are miserable blasphemers‚Äîwould
Your Highness speak for a man who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>remained covered while the Host passed, or one who
mocked a statue of the Virgin?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I would not burn them quick," replied William, "nay,
I would not touch their lives at all, nor yet their properties."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness has of late been dangerously clement
towards these heretics," remarked the Duchess.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is but natural," replied the Prince, with a smile,
"since most of those dearest to me are heretics. But I
do not speak from clemency but from policy when I
advise Your Grace to toleration."</p>

<p class='c000'>Again the secretary made that little movement; William
could imagine the letter he would write to Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Toleration?" cried the Duchess angrily; "do you
advise me to accord toleration to heretics?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," said William, and he looked at the Spaniard
sitting quiet in his corner, for he felt he was speaking
not to Margaret but to Philip, and that his words, spoken
in this chamber of the Brabant palace, would soon be
known in that cell of the Escorial where the laborious
King sat painstakingly annotating his lengthy and innumerable
dispatches.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duchess knew not what to answer; all her policy
of flattery and conciliation was overwhelmed by the rage
and contempt she felt for William's views, which vexed
her the more as she vaguely knew they were, from the
point of policy, right.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Netherlands," continued William, "will never
take the Inquisition. They will never give up heresy.
If they are forced they will be maddened into a revolt."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The King will know how to deal with revolt," returned
Margaret haughtily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The King," said William, again turning his dark eyes
on Armenteros, "will scarcely provoke a revolt. He has
too much wisdom and too little right."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You question the King's right?" exclaimed the
Duchess aghast.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Madame," the Prince reminded her, "the States and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the cities have charters and liberties older than the sovereignty
of the House of Burgundy. And both His Majesty
and the Queen Mary, the late Regent, swore to protect
these liberties."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But the King cannot, will not, endure heresy!" cried
Margaret.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Emperor was as good a Catholic as His Majesty,"
said William, "and he suffered heresy in his dominions
when he was leaguing with the Protestant Princes of
Germany. Therefore the King may suffer it sooner than
spoil, ruin, and lose the richest portion of his realms."</p>

<p class='c000'>"They would not revolt‚Äîthey would not dare!" said
Margaret.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They will dare a great deal, these Netherlanders, once
they are roused," returned the Prince, "as Your Grace
may have observed in the great numbers who refuse to
recant their heresy, even for their lives, and in those
who proclaim their faith knowing well what the penalties
are."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness is very zealous in the cause of these
wretched people," said the Duchess, with some bitterness.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Call me zealous in the cause of His Majesty," replied
William. "Before God, all I say and do is loyally said
and done, and with the sole desire to preserve peace and
contentment and obedience in these States."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do believe you," returned Margaret hastily; she
was unwilling to provoke further disputes, and considered
it easier to take the Prince at the mere face value of his
words than to endeavour, as she might so easily have
done, to find offence in the possible meanings of them.
"I believe and trust Your Highness, and shall look to your
good help and counsel to assist me."</p>

<p class='c000'>The question of the enforcement of the Inquisition was
thus evaded; it was a question Margaret preferred not
to have to answer, and one William saw no use in insisting
on, so well did he know the mind of the Regent and the
King on this subject.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>"Time," he contented himself by saying, "will prove
if I am right in what I say; and also my honest purpose
to serve His Majesty and Your Grace."</p>

<p class='c000'>He rose, and again his glance travelled to the keen, sharp
face of the secretary, who had now risen also and stood
very respectfully in his corner.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Does he think I do not know that he is a spy on me?"
considered William, as he kissed the Regent's hand; "does
she think I am going to be her tool to do hangman's
work?"</p>

<p class='c000'>He took his leave: Margaret gracious and smiling,
pressing him and his family to come to her banquets,
beseeching his frequent presence at her councils; the
secretary all deference and stately homage.</p>

<p class='c000'>When William had closed the door behind him, he laughed
softly, then, as he turned away down the tapestried
corridor, he sighed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It might be easy to read Margaret, even to manage her;
it might be easy, too, to influence and control those who
composed her councils; but behind Margaret was the
most powerful, the most fanatic, the most unscrupulous,
the most obstinate King in the world, and behind him
and his Inquisition was a more powerful force still‚Äîthe
entire might, the whole weight of the Holy Roman Church,
armed not only with the fire and sword of this world, but
the punishments of hell and the rewards of heaven.</p>

<p class='c000'>The liberties of the Netherlands were signed and sealed
in laws and charters, but what could parchment and ink
avail against the temporal power of Philip; the heretics
might be courageous and unyielding, but what were they
compared to the spiritual power of the Pope, supported
by all the great Princes of Europe?</p>

<p class='c000'>And what could William of Orange hope to achieve
if he set himself against any of the desires of Philip?
Merely that speedy and mysterious death that awaited
the King's disobedient servants.</p>

<p class='c000'>These thoughts did not occur to Egmont, to Montigny,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>to Brederode, to the other seigneurs who rejoiced in the
departure of Granvelle; they knew themselves free from
even a treasonable thought, and considered themselves
as safe as the Regent herself from the wrath of Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>But William had been educated at the Emperor's Court;
he had been for a while intimate with Philip; he knew
by heart the intricate policies of the Court, the blind
fanaticism, the narrow vanity, the dull obstinacy of the
King; and as surely as if he had seen it with his own eyes
he knew his name headed a list of the seigneurs the King
kept until he could one by one strike them off the paper‚Äîon
the day when they would be struck off the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Therefore he knew the difficulties, the perils of his
position, though did no one else in the Netherlands, and
he had reason for looking thoughtful while Brederode
jested and the others laughed. As he was passing down
the great stairs he met Barlaymont coming up.</p>

<p class='c000'>This man, Granvelle's most detested follower, and the
one who had betrayed to him the secrets of the league
of seigneurs formed against him, was now entirely in disgrace.
The Duchess received him with rudeness, and those
who had formerly fawned on him now rushed to pay court
to his ascendant enemies. He was white and haggard with
humiliation and vexation, his eyes red with bitter tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked up, coloured at seeing William, and paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince came down slowly, a slender figure in a
cross-cut doublet of a peacock colour, a mantle of red and
black fur; he carried his cap and switch under his arm,
and was fastening his fringed gauntlets with a gold thread.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness has soon come to the scene of your
triumph," said Barlaymont.</p>

<p class='c000'>William turned serene eyes on him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, Baron, I do not triumph," he said, half sadly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think Your Highness does when you step into the
place of the man you have cast down."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was not I," replied William, "it was the Netherlands
that would not endure the Cardinal."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>"You take refuge behind that," said Barlaymont
bitterly, "but it shall not save you. Now you exult.
Now you think to put your foot on our party, and for a time
you may. But I tell you that you have won a perilous
victory."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I know it," said the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now you are supreme, now you are the favourite,"
continued the fallen minister. "But the King is not so
easily dared, so safely affronted. As surely as now you
are uppermost, Philip will call you and those behind you
to account‚Äîto a very stern account, Highness."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You speak as the mouthpiece of Madrid," said the
Prince, "and doubtless have good authority for these
threats. Tell those who instructed you that I know my
position and their power."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I speak for myself only," replied Barlaymont, "to let
you know that I am only for the moment disgraced and
humiliated‚Äîdown as I am, I would not change to stand
in your Highness's place! Nay, I would not wear your
present honours at the cost you must pay‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do believe it," answered William; "but you and I
are different men, Barlaymont, and my house has never
shirked perilous honours."</p>

<p class='c000'>He bent his head and passed on, lacing again his glove.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the bottom of the stairs a flood of crimson light
lay, cast by the two windows filled with red and gold
glass, through which the last rays of the winter sun was
streaming; and as William descended, it gradually enveloped
him and dyed him red as if he was passing into a sea of
blood, over his feet, to his waist, to his shoulders, closing
over his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he passed into the darkness of the shadowed hall
beyond and was lost to Barlaymont's watching eyes.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I<br /> THE PIGEON</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>The sunshine of late summer was mellow in the
beautiful room that looked on the garden where the
last roses bloomed amid the heavy luxuriance of
foreign shrubs and flowers; golden the fair light of afternoon
filled the chamber as amber-coloured wine might fill
a dark cup, and there was no sound save the insistent
ticking of the tall clock in the corner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The room served no particular purpose, but was a mere
antechamber to the library or corridor between that and
a great chamber used for receptions and feasts.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e le Meung stood at the window looking on the
hushed and sunny garden. She liked this chamber, and
spent her little leisure there. She was not commonly
disturbed, as the Prince's luxurious household seldom used
this handsome library, and she had come to be fond of the
room, to regard it almost as her own‚Äîmore her own than
the hot little bedchamber under the eaves, where she
was within sound of Anne's persistent bell and ceaseless
shrill demands.</p>

<p class='c000'>She knew and liked the several pieces of furniture here‚Äîthe
large dark cupboard opposite to the window which
was polished till it gleamed like steel; the Spanish chairs
with gilt leather fringed seats either side; the waxed and
shining picture, as bright as a jewel and as flat as a mosaic,
that hung above the door into the library, and the other
picture, a portrait of a fat, stern gentleman in black,
handling the massive chain round his neck, which was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>opposite above the other door; and the tall wooden clock
with the delicately engraved steel face and the numbers
cut in flourishes fine as pen-strokes.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no other furnishing save the three brocade
cushions that filled the seat of the high Gothic window,
yet the chamber had an air of richness and beauty and peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e's eyes lifted presently to the picture above the
library door and dwelt there curiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a Flemish painting, perhaps a hundred years
old, and represented a young saint, Agnes, Barbara, or
Cecilia, being led out to martyrdom.</p>

<p class='c000'>The virgin, robed in white, with fair hair, combed carefully
in thin curls over her slanting shoulders, stood in the
midst of a neat and flowery field, on which daisies and other
little plants shone like stars.</p>

<p class='c000'>She lifted her round and smiling face, which was freshly
coloured and seemed never to have known care nor trouble,
to a clear and lovely blue sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>Behind her the executioners, elaborately clad in ruffled
scarlet breeches and embroidered doublet, stood ready with
rope and axe, and in the distance a hill town showed against
the blue horizon with the distinctness of a toy model.</p>

<p class='c000'>The picture fascinated R√©n√®e, it was so serene, so pleasant,
so far removed from horror or disgust, terror or pain, that it
might make a tired soul long to die that way, calm and
smiling in a daisied meadow that was but one step from the
paradise where a martyr's crown was already being plaited
by the angels and saints.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were martyrs now; men, women, and children as
pious, as steadfast as any of the early Christians whom
heathens slaughtered and to whom altars were set up all
over Europe, died every day in the Netherlands. But not
that way.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e knew it was not that way, the way of peace, with
flowers beneath and the blue heavens above‚Äînay, it was
in the common day-time, amid the sordid surroundings
of the market-place, with insults, with jeers, with flames,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>smoke, the shrieks of fellow-victims, the frenzied preaching
of the monks, the groans of the crowd, with their ravaged
homes perhaps within sight, their frantic children driven
back by the soldiers, with all the details of pain and misery
and dreariness, with none to comfort nor encourage‚ÄîR√©n√®e
knew that this was how the Netherlanders died‚Äîdied
daily by every manner of torture, by every form of
terrible and horrible death.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were some who were never seen in the market-place
nor on the public gallows; these were they who were
thrown into the prisons of the Holy Inquisition, and never
more came forth from the dark only lit by the glare of the
torture fires, or the silence broken only by groans of mortal
agony and the calm adjurations of the monks.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e turned her eyes away from the picture. "It was
never like that," she said to herself; "it lies‚Äîand who can
tell that the heavens opened to receive them, and the
saints crowded to welcome them? Who can tell? Who
has seen it?"</p>

<p class='c000'>She gazed into the Prince's garden, but the fairness of it
brought no peace to her heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>A warm breeze waved the costly flowers and the carefully
tended trees in the groves and alleys. Two young men were
playing tennis in the foremost court; the white balls sped
gracefully against the green, the soft-shod figures moved
noiselessly to and fro behind the nets.</p>

<p class='c000'>In and out of the gables and crevices of the palace
pigeons flew; their hoarse cooing was steady in the stillness.
Now and then their strong wings beat past the window,
and presently one settled on the open lattice, and moving
its flexible head, gazed at R√©n√®e with an eye as red and bright
as a ruby.</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked at the bird with admiration; it was an exquisite
thing, white and black shot with purple, all gleaming in the
sunlight and ruffled with pride.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then suddenly, as R√©n√®e looked, it flew straight past her
into the room and beat against the black bureau.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>R√©n√®e rose and clapped her hands to frighten it away,
but the bird clung to the polished wood, fluttering the
gleaming wings, the soft body panting and quivering.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she approached, it flew again with a powerful stroke of
the fine wings cutting the air, and beat frantically from door
to door, passing and repassing the open window.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Poor silly thing!" cried R√©n√®e; "so do we all beat
about in our prisons when the door is open on the sky!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The pigeon settled on the frame of the Flemish picture,
and looked down, palpitating, the tumbled breast heaving,
the bright eyes alert and anxious.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e stood helpless by the open window, her hand on
her bosom and a little flush of colour in her grave face.</p>

<p class='c000'>The opening of the door from the reception room caused
her to turn with a start (she was so seldom disturbed in this
chamber) and the pigeon to fly up and round the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>He who entered shut the door instantly and gave a
quick glance at R√©n√®e in her warm, opulent beauty and
severe blue gown, and then at the bird flashing like a
gleam of light in the dusky darkness of the high ceiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e stood in a foolish confusion; it was long since she
had seen him save at a distance, and his sudden appearance
bewildered her completely.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The bird is a prisoner?" he asked, and he spoke quite
gravely, though he smiled a little.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It will not see the open window, Highness," she replied;
and as she spoke, the pigeon circled lower in exhausted
fashion, and settled on the back of one of the black chairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince put out his hand gently and easily and caught
the bird by the wings, and so held it out, the coral-coloured
feet contracted, the red gold-rimmed eyes bright with fear.</p>

<p class='c000'>He took the struggling creature to the window and let it
fly; it sped far away, above and beyond the tennis court.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned to look at R√©n√®e. Their eyes met; words
rushed to her lips, and she spoke almost without meaning
to and against her own awe and shamefacedness.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>"Oh, Seigneur!" she exclaimed, "you are so tender
with a little bird, will you not do something for the Netherlands?"</p>

<p class='c000'>His look was surprised, almost startled. "Do I not do
something for them?" he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not know," was wrung from R√©n√®e's bitter heart.
"Your Highness is orthodox. Your Highness conforms.
There were great hopes of you‚ÄîI, among the first, believed;
but now‚Äîthe time goes‚Äîand‚Äîyou do nothing!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, seeing his expression of marvel, her face became
burning with painful red, and she turned her head quickly
away.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It must be to Your Highness as if your dog should
turn to speak to you," she said humbly. "I entreat you
to pass on and forget."</p>

<p class='c000'>"No," replied William, with perfect graciousness. "It is
not my way to either pass on or forget. Tell me what you
mean."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I cannot," said R√©n√®e. "My heart is very full, and
prompts me to foolishness. I am a heretic, and therefore
life cannot be pleasant to me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But you are safe here," answered the Prince gently.</p>

<p class='c000'>That stung her into again forgetting who he was and
her own insignificance.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That makes it more horrible!" she cried, and she
turned towards him. Her flushed and glowing face was very
beautiful in its utter unconsciousness of either beauty or
allure. "<em>I</em> am safe, but others better than I die every
day‚Äîdie horribly‚Äîburned alive, buried alive, tortured to
death. The Netherlands are a shambles, Seigneur; the
smoke of human sacrifice fouls the air. And it will be worse."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ay," said William quietly. "If the King enforce the
findings of the Council of Trent, it will be worse."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He will not dare!" exclaimed the girl, "for that would
mean to exterminate the Netherlanders."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not know what he would dare," returned William,
in the same low, quiet tone. "I do not know."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>R√©n√®e bit her lip to keep the hot words back; the long
habit of her servitude controlled her to silence. She stood
dutifully waiting for him to go from her presence, and forget
her amid the thousand incidents of his gorgeous life.</p>

<p class='c000'>But instead he stopped directly before her and spoke
again, kindly, but with a certain challenge.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What makes you appeal to me? What makes you
think I could or would do anything for these heretics
against whom the infallible voice of the Church has just
cried, 'Anathema, three times anathema'?"</p>

<p class='c000'>His tone spurred her to answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Because you are the greatest Prince in the land‚Äîbecause
the people have faith in you."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But I am only half trusted," he smiled. "You may
see as many pasquils pasted on my walls as on those of
any man in Brussels."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is because Your Highness will not declare yourself.
At one time, when you led the faction against the
Cardinal, we all hoped"‚Äîher voice faltered a little‚Äî"but
since then you have chosen to be secret, close‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"There are others," he said‚Äî"Brederode, Egmont,
Hoorne‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah," replied R√©n√®e, lifted beyond her tumultuous
fear of him, the sweet dread of his presence, "none of
these is the man we seek. In the people is the strength,
the ardour, the force; these nobles dance and jest and
brawl and spend, but do they believe, do they care‚Äîwould
they <em>die</em> for their God? All in the hands of Philip, all
conforming to Church and State, all bowing the neck to
the Regent and Peter Titelmann with his Holy Inquisition."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You do some wrong," said William. "Montigny and
Berghen have refused to enforce the Inquisition in their
provinces, and all the nobles have protested to His
Majesty against the dicta of the Council of Trent becoming
law in the Netherlands."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Forgive me," said R√©n√®e, "I fear I grow bitter‚ÄîI
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>forget all bounds‚ÄîI forget even that I am your
servant."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Speak to me," answered the Prince. "I would hear
your thoughts. It is not often I meet with one so well
versed in affairs, and so warm-hearted. You are a fair
young woman," he added, with great gentleness, "to be
so weighted with sad business."</p>

<p class='c000'>The blood flowed back on her heart and left her unnaturally
pale at these kind words from him; she dared
to look into his face; he stood near enough for her to
have touched him with a half-outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her quick glance saw that his face was tired in expression;
his dress, black, gold, and crimson, less gorgeous than
usual, almost careless compared with his habitual magnificence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The small head with the close waves of stiff dark
chestnut hair was held a little droopingly; the charming
ardent countenance, brilliant and dark, the dusky complexion
showing the fine blood in warm tints, the wide
vivacious eyes, the lips soft and firm, was overcast, the
level brows knitted, the firm chin fallen on the double
ruff of gold-edged cambric.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was troubling him, servant of King Philip,
principal adviser of the Regent, most powerful noble in
the Netherlands? What care had he unless the woes
of these wretched thousands the Council of Trent had
condemned to fire for soul and body touched and moved
him?</p>

<p class='c000'>In his gravity, in his look of fatigue and preoccupation,
R√©n√®e found hope; she stepped back from him and stood
with her shoulders pressed against the window embrasure
where the waxed wood gleamed in the sunlight that was
reddening to the west.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, you could do so much, you could do it all," she
said, and her gentle voice was rough and unsteady with
passion. "I have dreamt it‚Äîothers have thought it‚Äîyou,
you might be the man! You might redeem us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>from slavery, from tyranny, from misery unutterable‚Äîyou
are he who might defy Philip."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am his subject," said William, narrowing his eyes
on her face, "and I am a Papist."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But you are united to Protestant princes, and the
young princes, your brothers, are heretics," she answered,
as if she was pleading with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am in Philip's service," he said, and lifted his head,
looking at her straightly and intently.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was quick in her reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But your first loyalty is to the statutes of this land,
which Philip rends and spurns, and your first obligation
is the freedom and liberty of the land you help govern."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah! You know that, do you?" exclaimed the Prince,
and his expressive face changed, and seemed for a moment
to be joyous; then the look of reserve closed over the
flash of daring and animation, and he added quietly:
"The Regent has sent a protest to His Majesty telling
him it is impossible to enforce stringent laws against
heretics in the Netherlands. And it is likely, it must
be, that the King will see reason in her arguments."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is it likely?" asked R√©n√®e, looking steadily at the
Prince. "Your Highness knows the King."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, if he does not‚Äî‚Äî" said William, then suddenly
checked himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If he does not?" repeated the girl swiftly. "What
will Your Highness do?"</p>

<p class='c000'>He seemed to utterly withdraw into himself, and his
face was smooth and serene as a mask.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I see you still have hopes of me," he smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>She could not answer; she felt that he was lightly
putting her off, gently showing her she had overstepped
all etiquette, only to speak folly. Her enthusiasm, her
exaltation were swept away by a wave of humiliation.
She stood with downcast eyes, trembling in her place.</p>

<p class='c000'>William looked at her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My child," he said, with that note of pity and tenderness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>in his voice R√©n√®e found unbearable, "there was
never tyrant yet without some one to withstand, nor any
oppression or cruelty some strength did not break through.
Take courage, hold up your heart‚Äîsome one will arise
to face even King Philip and his Holy Inquisition."</p>

<p class='c000'>She could only bend her head and say, "Forgive me,
forgive what I have said‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>He raised his hand with a little gesture as if he would
check her protestations, then turned away and entered
the library.</p>

<p class='c000'>There, amid the rich furnishings, in the silence, broken
only by the call of the pigeons without, he stood thoughtfully,
as if he had forgotten what he had come here for;
the sunshine, red now as molten gold, flushed the tapestries,
the rows of gilded books, the carved walls and ceilings,
the bureaus of gleaming Chinese lacquers, the brocade
and velvet chairs, and this slender figure of the young
man standing erect, frowning, with one hand on his hip
and his face strangely sombre for one so young and
splendid.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II<br /> THE LOYALTY OF LAMORAL EGMONT</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Presently he turned and mounted the little step
leading to the low gallery which ran round the
bookcases that lined the rooms to the height of a man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince put his hand over the backs of a row of
ponderous books in gilt and calf which dealt with the laws
and statutes of the Netherlands; then, not finding the particular
volume he required, or losing interest in his impulse,
he turned away and crossed to a rare bureau of Chinese
work, the smooth brick-red lacquer surface of which was
heavily encrusted with gold birds and flowers, and there
seated himself and stared across the rich room to the
garden filled by the warm light of sunset.</p>

<p class='c000'>His face was very grave, almost weary; his mouth was
set tightly, so that the lines of it were strained, and his
nostrils slightly distended.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently he took from his pocket a little notebook of
scented leather and slowly turned over the vellum pages,
which were closely covered with numbers and calculations.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was only lately that the Prince had deigned to take
more than the most superficial interest in the management
of his vast affairs; he had been too great, too rich, too
powerful for any misgivings as to the future. But recently
it had been forced on his attention that his fortunes needed
mending; his debts were enormous, many of his estates
mortgaged; half of his French lordships were not paying
their revenues, many others were let at below their value.
For fifteen years, ever since he had had an establishment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>his own, he had been spending money like water to maintain
a life and a magnificence such as many emperors had not
attained; his houses, his horses, his falcons, his kitchens,
his entertainments were the most splendid in the land, and
famous in Europe, and even his enormous income had felt
the strain of such lavishness.</p>

<p class='c000'>None of his services under Philip had been lucrative; his
mission to offer the crown imperial to the new Emperor on
the abdication of Charles had been a costly honour, as it had
been undertaken at his own expense, and had meant the
expenditure of a fortune; his emoluments from his present
offices did not touch his outlay, and he was outside that
circle of the Regent's favourites (such as the Spanish
secretary, Armenteros) who enriched themselves from
public funds, nor had he ever received any of the rewards
and benefits which had permitted Cardinal Granvelle to
retire a rich man.</p>

<p class='c000'>His second marriage, put through in face of so much
opposition and difficulty, had proved a disastrous failure.
Anne, unbalanced from the beginning, was now almost a
maniac, a disgrace and a humiliation to her proud husband;
her dowry had done little more than pay for the wedding
festivities, and the alliance with the German Princes, her
kinsmen, which William had hoped to create, remained
more than doubtful.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were his brothers‚ÄîLouis, now sick and at Spa;
Adolphus and Henry, who had just left the college of
Louvain,‚Äîlooking to him for advancement, for John, who
had set up his household at Dillenburg, was too limited in
means to do anything, and there were his own son and the
little daughters; responsibilities, burdens, anxieties there
were in plenty, and he stood alone to meet them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Certainly he was at present the most powerful person in
the Netherlands, and had been since the fall of Granvelle,
but he knew perfectly well that this power was principally
rather in outward seeming than in reality, and that his
position was more perilous than glorious.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>He did not trust Philip; he knew that Monarch hated
him, and was only waiting for the opportunity to hurl him
down; and he knew Philip hated him because he feared
him. Egmont had lately visited Spain, and there had been
caressed and flattered and cajoled by the King into forgetting
his grievances and those of the country he represented;
Montigny and Berghen were ready to accept an invitation
to Madrid; Hoorne stood out to trust His Majesty;
but William of Orange was not for a moment to be deceived
nor cajoled nor lured.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew the King.</p>

<p class='c000'>And he felt a great loneliness in this knowledge, a great
sense of standing alone; every one seemed to be either
Philip's tool, Philip's puppet, or else utterly deceived by a
few sweet words from the royal lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>It astonished as much as it grieved William that Egmont
should be so deceived, that Philip's kindness, Philip's
presents, Philip's hospitality should make the envoy of
the wrongs of the Netherlands forget his errand, and return
praising Philip's charity, Philip's clemency, Philip's
generosity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The thought of Egmont's folly spurred William to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>He walked about the room, frowning, thinking; how
was he, the only man who did not fear nor trust Philip, to
act now?</p>

<p class='c000'>Supposing Philip forced the Inquisition and, in the fury
of his bigotry, exterminated the Netherlanders in seas of
blood and flame?</p>

<p class='c000'>William stopped short in his pacing to and fro.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You shall not," he said suddenly, as if he spoke to a
living man before him.</p>

<p class='c000'>And indeed it was not difficult for the Prince to conjure
from the dusk the figure once so familiar to him: the
meagre form, the pallid face, the mild and blank blue eyes,
the projecting lower jaw with the full and tremulous under
lip, the yellow-red hair and beard‚Äîthe figure of the man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>who, with less brains than the meanest of his clerks, and
more bitter insane bigotry than any fanatic devotee, imposed
the terror of his rule over half the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>William could picture him as he had last seen him in the
streets of Flushing, the pallid face livid, the lips twisted
into a snarl that showed the broken teeth, the foolish blue
eyes injected with blood, while he stammered, in answer
to the Prince's serene and courteous excuse‚Äî"Not the
States, but you‚Äîyou!" using the first person as if he had
addressed a servant. William had turned on his heel and
left him, not even escorting him as far as the shore where
he was to embark.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had not seen each other since; in spite of his constant
promises it did not seem as if Philip would ever set
foot in the Netherlands again, and William would have as
soon walked into fire as have gone to Spain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the presence of the King was ever with him, an
intangible foe, an all-pervading enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince did not know which of his servants, nay,
which of his friends, was secretly in the pay or service of
Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>But William also had been trained at the Court of
Charles V; he had his spies in the Escorial, his agents in
Madrid, and he was better informed as to the King's doings
than the Regent herself, who was but a puppet in that vast
game of triple intrigue and interwoven duplicity, that
confusion of lies and counter-lies and manifold deceptions
which the Court of Spain called statecraft.</p>

<p class='c000'>William's thoughts went back to the same point again
and again‚Äîthe point that was indeed the centre of his
problem‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"If the King forces the edicts against heretics‚Äîwhat
to do?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The final issue of slaughter, torture, emigration, and woe
unutterable he saw with vision unconfused; he foresaw,
too, the ruin of all the great Flemish nobles who refused
to be Philip's executioners.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>All Stadtholders, all magistrates, all officials who refused
to enforce the King's orders would be dismissed from their
offices, probably imprisoned, certainly disgraced; their
estates would, of a necessity, share the inevitable ruin
of the country; their fortunes would be lost in the general
bankruptcy.</p>

<p class='c000'>So much was obvious; it was obvious also that the only
way to escape this ruin would be to submit to Philip, to
support his policy, to fulfil his decrees, to obey him in
everything with implicit loyalty.</p>

<p class='c000'>And what was Philip going to demand?‚Äîthat these
noblemen, of as proud a birth as his own, become inquisitors,
executioners, the despoilers of their native
land or the land whose charters and liberties they had
sworn to protect?</p>

<p class='c000'>Impatient with his own thoughts and with circumstances
William left the library and returned to his cabinet, where
two secretaries were working by the light of lamps of red
Florentine copper.</p>

<p class='c000'>William had scarcely entered when Lamoral Egmont
was ushered into his presence; the Prince took his friend
by the hand and, greeting him pleasantly, led him into the
outer chamber, already lit by tall candles in polished brass
sticks shining like pale gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>William had not had so much of the Count's company
of late; Egmont was generally in attendance on the Regent,
who flattered his vanity by affecting to lean on his advice,
and since his return from Madrid he had rather shunned
the society of the Prince, for he was a little uneasy, a little
ashamed, at the ease with which Philip had lured him from
his ancient allegiance to the plans and policy of his friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stood now awkwardly, like a man with something
on his mind, his fine and gallant head held rather defiantly
high, his handsome features flushed and troubled. The
Prince observed him closely, but was silent, waiting for
him to speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have been with the Regent to-day," said Egmont at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>last; "she commands my assistance in the preparation of
these wedding festivities. It becomes wearisome," he
added, with some impatience.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince made no comment; he was not very interested
either in all these pompous feasts and tourneys which
were to celebrate the marriage of the Regent's son (whom
Egmont had brought back from Spain with him) and the
Princess Maria of Portugal. It was an ill time for this
extravagant and lavish rejoicing, and neither bride nor
groom pleased the Prince; besides, the memory of his own
costly wedding festivities was still fresh and unpleasantly
vivid in his mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Regent heard to-day from Spain," added Egmont
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince looked at him sharply.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Was it an answer to the protest about the decrees of
the Council of Trent?" he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not know‚Äîshe would not make the news public.
But I know the tidings were ill, the tears were in her eyes
and her breath came short, and on the first excuse she
could, she hurried from me and retired to her chamber.
And, later, I heard the young Prince, her son, say that if
all the heretics were exterminated, God would be well
pleased."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He will be a rod and a scourge, that youth," remarked
William. "I never met one with so much pride. So
Philip will cut the Netherlanders to the measure of the
Pope's yardstick?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not say so," replied Lamoral Egmont hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay, but in your heart you know it," returned the
Prince. "Now you are away from the seductions of the
Escorial you know that Philip is‚ÄîPhilip."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Stadtholder of Flanders winced and flushed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I see no cause to mistrust the King's word," he
answered obstinately. "He spoke to me graciously‚Äîwith
charity and kindness‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"My poor Lamoral!" exclaimed William with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>sarcasm he could not restrain, "and could a little sweetness,
the false Spanish honey, so easily lure you into the
net? Do you really believe in Philip's caresses, Philip's
promises?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have always been loyal," said Egmont. "I have
never offended His Majesty."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have‚Äîwe all have," answered William. "Do
you think he has forgotten that we forced him to remove
Granvelle? Do you think he has forgiven the jest of the
livery?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The Count laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, I have dined at the Regent's table in camlet,
doublet, and the device‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"And she has smiled and flattered. She is Philip's
sister," remarked the Prince drily. "Trust none of
them. The King is only waiting for his revenge."</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont paled a little and looked at William uneasily;
he felt himself again coming under the Prince's influence,
again affected by the Prince's warning; he began to
entertain a horrid doubt: Philip's sincerity, if that was
all a snare?‚Äîif the King was offended with him beyond
appeasement?‚Äîhis very soul shuddered before that
possibility and what it meant.</p>

<p class='c000'>William saw his hesitancy and spoke again‚Äîspoke
earnestly and ardently as a man would to save a friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Egmont, believe none of them," he said. "The King
loves us not‚Äîhe has those about him who do not allow
him to forget‚Äîkeep out of his power, eschew his flatteries,
trust neither him nor his creatures."</p>

<p class='c000'>But Philip's blandishments were still too fresh in the
Count's ears, he was too secure in the consciousness of his
own loyalty to give more than a passing heed to any
warning, much as he was impressed by the force of the
Prince's stronger character. He reassured himself by
recalling the Regent's favour, the King's promises of
benefits and rewards; and he was a man hampered with
debts, with daughters to dower presently‚Äîa man who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>needed magnificence, splendour, the atmosphere of Courts,‚Äîa
man ductile under the flattery of the great.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are too prudent, too cautious," he answered, with
a vehemence to cover his momentary hesitation and
alarm. "I cannot overstep loyalty‚Äîyou sail near to
defiance of His Majesty's authority."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If the King forces the Inquisition, what will you do?"
asked William suddenly and abruptly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont flushed and stammered.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I? I must stand by my duty‚Äîit is true these heretics
must be outrooted. I am treating them with severity‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You will stand by the King," said the Prince briefly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What else?" demanded the Count. "I am satisfied
His Majesty will not push matters past prudence."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you call it prudence if he insists on measures being
forced on the country which will mean every inhabitant
being put to the sword or flying overseas?‚Äîthat will
mean the ruin of every trade, every industry, every
business?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay," said Egmont, "the heretics will come back to
the true Church."</p>

<p class='c000'>William smiled at the weakness of this.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If Philip were to send every soldier he possesses to
the Netherlands to force the Inquisition and the decrees of
the Council of Trent by the sword, not one of these people
would change his faith."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You speak as one too favourable to heresy," cried the
Count.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I speak as one knowing well these heretics and the
power of the faith they hold."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Would we could extirpate that cursed faith," exclaimed
Egmont impatiently, "which, like a foul weed
in a fair garden, has brought confusion and misery where
there was order and peace!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, you are a good Catholic," said William quietly,
"and you, too, have tried to put a bridle on men's consciences
and whip them to the mass‚Äîyou have hanged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>and burned to clear heresy from Flanders‚Äîbut you will
never succeed, Count Egmont, and all your efforts will
not save you from King Philip, loyal and pious as you
are."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You, too, are a good Catholic," answered Egmont.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, yes, I am a good Catholic," replied the Prince
indifferently.</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned aside to snuff the candles that stood on the
low table by the heavy carved fireplace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont was silent; with every moment, with every
word, these two, once so inseparably friends and allies,
were widening the distance between each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident that in the struggle between Philip and
William for Egmont, Philip had won; the Stadtholder of
Flanders stood firm to Church and King; he had been
bought, as Granvelle had always said he could be, by a
little flattery, a few promises.</p>

<p class='c000'>But still the charm and power of the Prince held him, he
regretted the old confidence, the old alliance.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What will Your Highness do?" he asked a little
wistfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince smiled and, turning towards him, pressed his
hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Whatever I do, I think I shall stand alone," he answered.
"You will remain my friend though, Lamoral?"
he added, and his dark eyes were eloquent with affection.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Always," replied Egmont. "Come what will, I do
not leave my friends so easily, Prince."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We will talk no more of politics when we are together,
and so we shall keep our conversation sweet; the times are
difficult and bloody, and it is well to forget them," replied
William.</p>

<p class='c000'>They spoke together a while on indifferent topics, their
hawks, their hounds, their debts, the last extravagance
of Brederode, Montigny's approaching marriage, the arrogance
of the young Prince of Parma‚ÄîMargaret's son‚Äîand
the severe piety of his bride‚Äîthe Portuguese Princess.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Only when Egmont was leaving did William refer
again to the first topic of their conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is Count Hoorne of your mind?" he asked, as he
stood with his guest on the great stairs. "About trusting
Spain?" he explained.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah yes," said Lamoral Egmont.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And Hoogstraaten?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That‚ÄîI do not know."</p>

<p class='c000'>They parted affectionately, and William returned into
his palace which, for all the magnificence and luxury and
splendour and moving to and fro of servitors, was somehow
lonely and desolate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince mounted the gorgeous stairs slowly, with his
eyes downcast; as he gained the first landing he raised
them, to see the figure of his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was going up the stairs before him, half-crouching
against the wall and dragging at the tapestries; her heavy
handsome skirts trailed loosely after her; her white head-cloth
was soiled and disarranged; she was sucking a
stick of sweetmeat, and her pale flaccid face clouded with
an instant expression of dislike and annoyance touched
with fear when she observed her husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>He glanced away, and turned across the landing to his
cabinet; she crept on up the stairs, muttering to herself,
and looking back at him with a half-snarl like a malignant
animal.</p>

<p class='c000'>So now the Prince and his wife met and passed.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III<br /> THE AMUSEMENTS OF THE PRINCESS OF<br /> ORANGE</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Dupr√®s‚Äîthe skryer, alchemist, and religious
refugee whom the Prince of Orange was sheltering‚Äîhad
arranged the two chambers allotted to him as
half shop, half laboratory, in the fashion of Vanderlinden, the
Elector Augustus' alchemist and Dupr√®s' former master.</p>

<p class='c000'>This fellow, partly charlatan, yet genuinely gifted, and
not without a wild flash of genius at times, and real moments
of spiritual insight and exaltation, had contrived, by the
fascination of the supernatural arts he professed and by
his wit and readiness in following the politics and scandals,
the rumours and whispers of the hour, to attach to himself
a considerable following, both in the Prince's household
and among those who came and went in the palace, and
whose visits to the alchemist (as he chose to call himself,
though he had little real pretension to any of the honours
of hermetic philosophy) were not noticed amid the manifold
distractions of the huge establishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Princess of Orange continued Dupr√®s' most ardent
patroness and most credulous dupe; she spent hours in
his laboratory watching him tell her fortune by means
of melted lead, by the markings in the blade bone of a
freshly killed sheep, by the arrangement of strange
Eastern playing-cards, or in observing the fusing and
transformation of various chemicals into powder and
essences which Dupr√®s declared were the first steps to the
discovery of the Philosopher's Stone.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>Anne was hot on this pursuit; the events that shook
the Netherlands, the threatened upheaval which might
overshadow her husband, the daily torture and death of
heretics, the cries arising from the tortured prisoners,
the Regent's anxiety and confusion, the enigmatic attitude
of the awful Philip‚Äînone of these things interested the
Lutheran Princess whose father had been so splendid a
champion of the Reformed Faith; but to stand over glass
retorts and glowing furnaces, to listen to the Frenchman's
tedious and learned explanations of matter she could
not even begin to understand, to meddle with signs and
wonders, to attempt to raise spirits, to experiment with
perfumes, dyes, and cosmetics‚Äîall this had a deep and
irresistible fascination for Anne of Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Dupr√®s made his full profit thereby, for he obtained
from her considerable sums of money, and when she had
not these to give, jewels, ornaments, and even costly
articles from her chambers. R√©n√®e le Meung had known
Dupr√®s at Dresden and then believed him to be a worthless,
though cunning creature, and she found it hard to
stand by and see him fool the Princess and mock the
Prince; but William and all the members of the Nassau
family who came and went in Brussels treated Anne
and her doings with magnificent indifference, Dupr√®s
was beneath their notice, and it was not in R√©n√®e to play
the tale-bearer and carry complaints of her mistress to
her master, so she, too, had to spend the dreariest of
hours listening to Dupr√®s' jargon and watching his futile
experiments, while the sickly smell of perfumes and the
acrid odour of chemicals made her head heavy and
feverish.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when the Princess began visiting the laboratory
alone, and the whispers and laughter grew among her
women, R√©n√®e went through an agony of hot shame and
bitter indignation compared to which the dullness of her
former life was peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne was making a jest of herself, and R√©n√®e winced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>as if she had herself been humiliated, not because of
Anne, but because of the name she carried.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards this momentous winter, when Brussels was
brilliant with the pompous marriage of Alexander of
Parma, Anne's women began to openly laugh at their
hated mistress.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had ceased to believe that she went to Dupr√®s'
studios solely to study magic and alchemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is to meet that young lawyer, Jan Rubens," they
said, and made a mock of her behind her back.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e, sick of living, sick of loving, weak and pale
with watching the ruin of her people and her faith, roused
at this.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The charlatan must go," she said, and all the women
laughed again and asked, 'Why? If Anne was quiet with
these amusements, why take them from her?'</p>

<p class='c000'>But R√©n√®e repeated, "He must go."</p>

<p class='c000'>She meant to take the desperate step of frightening
the fellow into leaving the palace, and so closing Anne's
dangerous means of communication with the outside world.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Princess of Orange and a Flemish lawyer!‚Äîit
was impossible that she should stoop so low or he look so
high, yet in her heart R√©n√®e did not trust Anne, and meanwhile,
if nothing else, she was trampling on her husband's
dignity and giving cause for little men to laugh at him.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a wild winter day when Anne, in a bitter and
stormy mood, had locked herself into her darkened
chamber, that R√©n√®e went on her distasteful errand to
the alchemist.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rain was hurled against the palace windows with a
force that shook the painted glass in the frames, and
lay in great pools beneath the swaying and broken trees
and bushes in the garden, until a great gust of wind would
come and suck up the water in the hollows and dry the
wet lashings on the windows and make the whole great
building tremble, then it would die away reluctantly,
and another black cloud would burst, drenching all again.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>R√©n√®e shuddered in her worn velvet (none of Anne's
women went splendidly) as she passed through the magnificent
corridors and stairways to the obscure chamber
where Dupr√®s lodged.</p>

<p class='c000'>To her surprise as much as to her relief and satisfaction
she found him alone, though she had to use some authority
to gain admission from the idle lad who kept his door.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s was in his outer room which opened directly
from the antechamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was bending over an alabaster table set on gilt
legs, which stood in the corner by the high window, and
mixing several brilliant liquids by means of a long silver
spoon.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the sound of R√©n√®e's firm step he turned, and the
sight of his face startled her, for he wore a glass mask
bound tightly round forehead and chin by strips of black
leather.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Mademoiselle le Meung!" he cried, in tones of
surprise and vexation, and, quickly covering his mixtures
with silver lids, he took off the mask and looked at her
keenly with his bright tired eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You did not wish to see me," remarked R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No," replied Dupr√®s, at once courteous and composed,
"you are wrong‚Äîno one could have been more welcome,
but I am engaged on an important experiment, and told
the lad I did not wish to be disturbed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, Monsieur Dupr√®s," said R√©n√®e, "do not seek
to delude me with these labours of yours‚ÄîI knew you in
Dresden."</p>

<p class='c000'>He placed a deep-seated leather chair for her in front
of the cedar-wood fire which emitted a perfumed heat,
and he answered calmly‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"You despise me and what I do, but there again you
are wrong. If I can make invisible ink, potent sleeping-draughts,
swift poisons, keen medicines, and cosmetics
to keep women beautiful, am I not of some use in the
great affairs of the world?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>"Ah, you suit your argument to your listener," replied
R√©n√®e. "Since you cannot dazzle me with your magic
and your alchemy you speak straightly, and I am thankful
for it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Blaspheme neither magic nor alchemy," he returned
thoughtfully. "All miracles are possible, but our wit
is so muddy we may not achieve them. I have talked
with angels and glimpsed infinity as certainly as I have
been drunk and a cheat."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Maybe," said R√©n√®e; she sat still, looking round
the strange room full of curious pictures and diagrams,
planetary signs, shelves of bottles and jars, rows of
ancient books and astronomical instruments. She was
tired, as always, and, as always, sad in spirit, and she felt
that what she had to say was an effort difficult to make.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s came and stood the other side of the wide hearth;
his long black gown, his flat velvet cap, the thick gold chain
round his neck, his grave, pallid, and wasted face gave him
the air of a scholar long closed from the light, but his restless
hands and his reckless eyes were those of a man of action.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have heard what is taking place in Brussels?"
he asked keenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I hear nothing," said R√©n√®e, "but the last scraps of
gossip from the pages and servants. I never leave the palace
and hardly the Princess's apartments."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I can tell you this," said Dupr√®s, with an air of lively
interest, "that the younger nobles, Brederode, Culemburg,
Hoogstraaten, De Hammes, have organized a league
against the enforcement of the decrees of the Council of
Trent. They had a meeting on the very eve of the Parma
wedding. What do you think of that?" he added, smacking
his lips. "Does it not look like splendid times ahead‚Äîconfusion,
chances, war, perhaps?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is the Prince in this, or Egmont or Hoorne?" asked
R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>"None of those, but the Count Louis‚Äîand Egmont's
house is as full of heretics as Geneva, while our dear master
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>is hardly a very good Catholic nor a very good loyalist,"
he added, with a slight, unpleasant smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waiting-woman flushed and felt her heart beating fast.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I must come to my errand," she said, "before we are
interrupted."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, your errand," repeated Dupr√®s keenly. "But
first, lest we misunderstand one another, are you in the
confidence of your mistress?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"As much as anyone is, perhaps," replied R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked at her searchingly, then his eyes fell; the
waiting-woman was conscious of a sudden wave of disgust,
of loathing for him and all the pretentious details of this
room so obviously arranged to impress the foolish and
ignorant, and this feeling gave her strength and courage to
speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You must leave the palace, Dupr√®s," she said; "it
would be better if you left Brussels, but this you must
leave, and at once."</p>

<p class='c000'>His whole face paled and hardened into a set look of
defiance and alarm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you mean? Who told you to say that?"
he asked roughly.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I speak on my own authority," she said quietly, "but
if you refuse to take my warning, I will go to the Prince."</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s winced so palpably and looked so hideously
alarmed that R√©n√®e was slightly astonished, slightly
softened.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Go at once," she added, following up her advantage;
"you have made enough plunder and may now try your
fortunes elsewhere."</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s rallied himself; his eyes flickered to the fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What have you against me?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are a plague spot, a fester in this house," answered
R√©n√®e. "You seduce the Prince's people with lies and
foolishness, you bring those here who have no right to enter
these doors."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>"The Princess wishes me to stay‚Äîgo to her with these
complaints, and hear her answer," cried Dupr√®s, with a
sudden snarl.</p>

<p class='c000'>His words woke R√©n√®e's lurking anger; she flashed from
coldness to heat.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Prince maintains you, shelters you, saved you‚Äînot
his wife‚Äîand your gratitude is to pander to her foolishness
and drain her of her very jewels by your tricks. And
there is worse than that, Dupr√®s, she meets here those
whom she should not meet, she degrades herself by consorting
with idlers in a charlatan's company. You know this‚Äîagain
I tell you, as a warning, you must go."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who gave you authority to talk so boldly?" exclaimed
the alchemist in a rage. "If my honoured lady deigns to
come here to watch my poor experiments, what is it to you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I will not argue on this theme," returned R√©n√®e.
"But if you are not gone within the week it shall be put
before His Highness that you bring disgrace and disorder
into his house."</p>

<p class='c000'>A curious expression of dislike, rage, and half-amusement
gleamed in the alchemist's narrowed eyes, but R√©n√®e,
already hot, agitated, and half-ashamed of her own errand,
her own plain speaking, was turning quickly and resolutely
away, when a sudden sound caused her to stop and turn
violently towards Dupr√®s.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a woman's laugh she heard‚Äîa high, shrill, long
laugh; it came from the alchemist's inner room, and was
unmistakably the laugh of Anne of Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a flash R√©n√®e remembered the private door from the
Princess's apartments which Anne had affected to have
locked and hidden under the tapestries, in a flash she
recalled the hours Anne had been seemingly enclosed in
her chamber‚Äînow it was all clear enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>"So she comes thus," said R√©n√®e, with tears in her eyes,
"and you have been the go-between!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No one is here‚Äîno one," stammered Dupr√®s, but he
backed before the door, and he was colourless and quivering.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>"She is there, and I will take her away," cried R√©n√®e.
"Who is with her‚Äîwho?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Go, go!" implored Dupr√®s; "there is none here but
a young wench who serves me. Oh, gods and angels!" he
cried in real terror, as R√©n√®e slipped behind him and seized
the handle of the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>She thought he was going to strike her or use his short
dagger on her, and she did not care; but the irresolution
and the mocking fatalism that were so strongly in this
man's character kept him from action.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is an end now," he said cynically, and stepped
behind the great chair where R√©n√®e had sat.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waiting-woman opened the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inner room was glowing with a rich firelight which
warmed the chilly gleam of the stormy daylight; the round
table was set with a lace cloth and all manner of sweets,
cakes, fruits, and wines; and before it, on a long couch, sat
the Princess of Orange and Jan Rubens, the young lawyer.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of his arms was round her waist, one of hers round
his neck; their flushed faces were pressed together, and
they were endeavouring to drink out of the same goblet,
a rare thing of rock crystal, in the form of a fish, mounted
in rubies and gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this R√©n√®e saw in a breath, and while she saw she
realized her own utter failure, the uselessness of all her years
of effort, of watchfulness, of endurance, of patience; she
had been outwitted like a fool. Anne had eluded her, and
gone straight to that shame, that degradation from which
R√©n√®e had laboured to save her; not even this service
had she been able to render the Prince, and that was the
bitterest thought of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>She stood silent, holding the door open, and the two at
the table stopped their foolish laughter and rose. Rubens
dropped the goblet; the wine spilt over his crumpled ruff
and his violet velvet suit.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Go to your room, Madame," said R√©n√®e, and spoke as
a mistress to a servant.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Anne was too frightened to answer; she shrank together
as if she expected to be beaten.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young lawyer tugged at his sword.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That fool Dupr√®s," he kept saying, "that fool
Dupr√®s‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e could see he was half-intoxicated; she turned
her back on him and spoke again to Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Go, go!" she cried. "Do you realize that you are
playing with death?"</p>

<p class='c000'>This last word seemed to recall Jan Rubens to his senses.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am ruined!" he cried. "I have a wife and children.
God forgive me! Oh, God forgive me!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned his face away and put his hands before his eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne limped towards the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, make haste!" whispered R√©n√®e, through strained
lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s came forward; he was the most composed of
the four, though there was terror in his eyes and his hands
shook.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Mademoiselle will not speak?" he said in a low voice,
catching hold of R√©n√®e's sleeve. "A little foolishness, a
little indiscretion‚ÄîMademoiselle would not make mischief
for that?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"A little foolishness," repeated Anne vaguely. She
began to weep. "May I not have my amusements?
You were always hard, R√©n√®e; do not be hard‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"See," said Dupr√®s, in a quick, eager whisper. "Keep
this from the Prince, and I will go away‚Äî<em>he</em> will leave
Brussels‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Make no bargains with me," cried R√©n√®e passionately,
exasperated with disdain of the cringing attitude of all of
them, by Anne's utter lack of dignity, by the horrid sordidness
of the thing she had disclosed, which sickened her as
one might be sickened by lifting a smooth stone and
discovering beneath a foul reptile. "You will go‚Äîall of
you‚Äîand at once."</p>

<p class='c000'>The young Fleming now stumbled forward into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>outer room. He was a big, clumsy man, fresh-coloured,
blonde, fair-bearded, and blue-eyed; his face was grey
and distorted with terror; he stood before R√©n√®e shuddering
like a lashed hound. She noted, with further contempt
for his utter cowardice, that he neither tried to bribe nor
threaten her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Will it be the rope‚Äîthe rope?" he asked. "Or
would the Prince grant the sword‚Äîfor my family's sake?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Go," cried R√©n√®e, "escape from here like the thing
you are!"</p>

<p class='c000'>She caught Anne's limp hand and dragged her to the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If he kills me," said the Princess sullenly, "he will
take a life that is worth nothing to me." She twisted
round in R√©n√®e's grasp to throw insult at the two men
standing foolishly side by side.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And you could neither strike a blow nor say a word,
tricksters and churls!"</p>

<p class='c000'>She said nothing more while R√©n√®e led her back through
the palace until they came to the great staircase window
which looked on the courtyard.</p>

<p class='c000'>A cavalcade, muffled against the weather, was leaving
the palace gates.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My husband going to the Council," muttered Anne.
"My husband!"</p>

<p class='c000'>When they reached the Princess's apartments, R√©n√®e
locked the secret door and took away the key.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne watched from where she crouched over the fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I suppose you despise me, hate me now?" she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e turned her beautiful haggard face towards her
mistress, and for the first time in her long bondage she
spoke what had ever been in her heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I always despised and hated you," she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I knew it," answered Anne apathetically, and sat silent
over the warmth of the flames till she fell heavily asleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the waiting-woman paced her little chamber in
agonies of torment, weeping unbearably bitter tears of
pain and shame and unavailing regret.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br /> PHILIP'S MANDATE</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>William of Orange rode up to the beautiful
Brabant palace in company with Egmont, who had
been dining with him, and several gentlemen who
were in attendance on both the noblemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont was silent, uneasy, almost sullen; he felt that
Philip was not carrying out the golden promises he had
made in Madrid, and that he had been more or less deceived
and cajoled; and though his loyalty was not shaken, he
was humiliated at appearing as a man of straw in the eyes
of William of Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince too was uneasy. He knew, by means of secret
information, that the Regent had received dispatches
from the King during her son's marriage festivities, and
had kept them concealed. He did not think this seemed
as if they contained good news; he saw everything very
gloomy and black ahead, very troubled and difficult, but
at least he hoped that the King had taken up some definite
attitude. To a man of William's temperament, Philip's
endless irresolution, interminable delays, shifty evasions,
blank silences, and long inaction were the most unbearable
of policies.</p>

<p class='c000'>They reached the palace wet with rain and blown with
wind, to find most of the other members of the Council
there before them, and already gathered in the presence
of the Regent in the splendid council chamber of the
ancient Dukes of Brabant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Baron de Barlaymont, the last representative of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>fallen party of Granvelle, was there seated humbly in his
usual quiet corner, where he was seldom noticed and seldom
spoke. His colleague Vigilius, President of the Privy Council,
was also present; he had but recently recovered from an
almost mortal illness which had seized him while preparing
an answer to the Prince of Orange's speech against the
Inquisition and the corruption of the Court, and had been
left by it almost useless, almost senseless.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thomas Armenteros, Margaret's Spanish secretary, was
there, and Admiral Hoorne, gloomy and sad.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Duke of Aerschot, the one noble who had unflinchingly
supported all Philip's measures, and the Sieur
de Glayon, completed, with the arrival of the Prince and
Egmont, the members of the Council of State; but the
ancient and feeble Vigilius was supported by several of
the learned doctors of law who composed the board of
the Privy Council of which he was President.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Regent sat in her usual place at the head of the
long table, working nervously at the usual length of
embroidery which served to give employment to her
restless fingers.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had aged of late; her face had hardened, and there
were strands of white in her thick, heavy hair. The firm
set of her powerful jaw and her majestic deportment gave
her a resemblance to the Emperor her father, but her eyes
were the eyes of a woman overwhelmed and frightened.</p>

<p class='c000'>When all the councillors were seated, she dropped her
work on to her lap and looked keenly and anxiously from
one face to another‚Äîthe dark, handsome face of Orange; the
old, feeble face of Vigilius; the downcast, bitter face of Barlaymont;
the beautiful, uneasy face of Egmont; the brooding,
sullen face of Hoorne; and the sleek, smiling face of Armenteros,
the secretary, who held the dispatches in his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret spoke; her shaking voice was rendered half
inaudible by the sound of the rain beating on the leaded
casements where glowed the arms of Brabant, and the
wind struggling with the heavy window-frames.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>William rested his hands on the soft Persian cloth that
covered the council table, and he, in his turn, looked
steadily at the Regent.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he was not considering, nor reckoning with, Madame
Parma; behind the figure of this confused, agitated woman,
whose task was too great for her wits, William saw the real
master, the pale King going to and fro his masses and his
cell in the Escorial, from whence he directed the destinies
of the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You shall hear the Royal commands, seigneurs,"
finished the Duchess, and she glanced at those two fine
shapely hands of William of Orange resting on the cloth in
front of him, and her look of fright deepened as if they had
held a bared sword towards her breast.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Read, read," she cried to Armenteros, in great agitation.
She caught up her work, but tears were in her eyes, and she
could not see the stitches.</p>

<p class='c000'>The secretary rose. He was a mere clerk, but since Granvelle's
downfall he had grown fat on the spoils of the corruption
of the Court, and now affected the great lord;
he was dressed in the Spanish style, close doublet and short
cloak in plain black velvet which disdained the French and
Flemish finery of button, lace, and feather, and wore a great
ruff of wired cambric so stiff that he could not turn his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>He bowed, but formally, to the councillors, and announced
that the present dispatches had been received a few days
before the Parma wedding, had been placed before the
Privy Council and by that body reported upon, which
report would be read after the Royal commands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoorne glanced at Orange, Egmont kept his eyes down,
Vigilius seemed scarcely less agitated than the Regent; he
shook as if slightly palsied, and the water stood in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Armenteros read the dispatches in a high-pitched clear
voice, which rose above the outer tumult of the wind and
rain; his dark, precise figure showed clear-cut in the grey
winter light against the dark panelled walls of the council
chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Philip's dispatches were prolix as always, but this time
they were neither obscure nor irresolute nor enigmatical.
The King had hesitated long, but now he was resolved, and
he spoke out his resolution with no uncertain words.</p>

<p class='c000'>The decrees of the Council of Trent were to be enforced
with full rigour, the Inquisition was to be given full power
and authority, all the placards and edicts against heretics
issued by the late Emperor were to be enforced, such
heretics as were at present in confinement awaiting judgment
were to be at once executed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In brief, the ancient religion was to be re-established by
sword and fire and faggot, by fine, by banishment, by ruin;
if need be, by the extermination of a whole people.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was to be no further temporizing, no appeal; the
secular judges were commanded to give all possible assistance
to the Inquisitors, and the Stadtholders were abjured
to protect them; all loyal subjects of the King were to
assist him in his ardent desire to uproot heresy, or to be
reckoned among those they protected.</p>

<p class='c000'>The passionate sincerity of the writer, "who would
rather die a hundred deaths than be the lord of heretics,"
illumined the diffuse and rambling letter as a flame does
darkness; the fierceness and force of this tremendous
decision was a mighty thing, the power of one overmastering
passion giving to a little man the semblance, the
terror of greatness.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the secretary folded up the letter and sat down, a
sound like a sob went through the room; then bitter protest,
like a cry of despair, broke from the pale lips of Egmont.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is not what His Majesty told me, this is not what
was promised‚Äîbefore God it is not!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"His Majesty has written to you, Count," said Margaret
hurriedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," admitted Egmont, "and the written words were
different enough from the spoken ones; yet I hoped‚ÄîI
still hoped‚Äî‚ÄîAh!" he broke out again passionately,
"by Christ, I hoped for something better than this!"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>So had Margaret; the emphatic severity of the King's
mandate, the now obvious hopelessness of his ever coming
in person to the Netherlands, the ruin ahead of the whole
country if the Royal orders were obeyed‚Äîthese things had
kept Madame Parma from rest and ease ever since she had
first read the fatal dispatches; and now her doubt, fear, and
vexation were beyond concealment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoorne spoke now; he was not given to many words,
and his speech was commonly to the point.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you intend to do, Madame?" he asked
grimly, and his usual disdain of women was heightened by
the sight of Margaret's obvious weakness.</p>

<p class='c000'>"His Majesty must be obeyed," said Barlaymont and
Aerschot almost in a breath; Vigilius and the secretary
murmured an assent; only William of Orange remained
silent, still looking down at his peaceful hands folded on
the edge of the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Read the comments of the Privy Council," said the
Regent desperately; and the secretary rose again, and in his
clear, expressionless voice read out the tedious report of the
Privy Council, which merely amounted to a strong recommendation
to the State Council to endorse the Royal
commands. When he had finished a passionate murmur
broke from Hoorne and Egmont.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What can I do?" asked Margaret, answering them
before they spoke. "I have made all representations to His
Majesty‚ÄîI have told him the state of the country, your own
protests. You, Count Egmont, have yourself been to Madrid
and laid the case of the Netherlands before His Majesty."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I will undertake no such mission again!" cried the
Stadtholder of Flanders stormily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It were wise not to," said the Seigneur de Glayon, with
meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is to be done?" asked Margaret weakly, and
she looked at Armenteros, the man on whom she had learnt
to rely, and he in his turn gazed at the rain-splashed panes
of the tall window at his side.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>William of Orange spoke for the first time since he had
entered the council room.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is nothing to be done," he said, "but to obey
the mandate of the King."</p>

<p class='c000'>They all looked at him, half in terror, half in relief,
Egmont almost incredulously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You!" he exclaimed. "You who were ever so hot
against the Inquisition, against religious oppression‚Äîyou
who would leave the very weavers and labourers free to
choose their faith?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"What I have said I maintain‚ÄîI think you know,
Count Egmont, that I maintain my words‚Äîbut I have
said already, at this very Board, all I can say. And now
the King's attitude is clear, his commands are definite,
his wishes unmistakable‚Äîlet them be fulfilled."</p>

<p class='c000'>So saying, the Prince turned his dark eyes on Margaret,
and there was an expression of challenge, of reserved
strength and judgment in them that caused the Regent
to feel doubtful of the support William so calmly offered.</p>

<p class='c000'>"To obey is to put a match to straw," she said in real
terror, "but to refuse is impossible."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ay, impossible," said William. He pointed to the
dispatches lying before Armenteros on the many-coloured
cloth. "There is Philip's mandate. Let it be obeyed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have no excuse to disobey," admitted Hoorne
sourly. "But what will the Netherlanders do?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"What will any of us do?" smiled William. "Let
His Majesty's wishes be put in force, and then it will be seen
what all will do."</p>

<p class='c000'>These words seemed to further frighten Margaret, who
had always been in awe of the powerful Prince of Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I count on Your Highness to support me in these
troubles," she said anxiously, and her tired eyes, full of
tears, fixed searchingly on William's serene and inscrutable
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>He slightly bowed his head, without replying; Egmont
traced the lines of a yellow tulip in the pattern of the cloth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>with his forefinger; Hoorne stared desolately in front of
him; Aerschot, Glayon, Barlaymont appeared amazed and
frightened; an air of gloom, of foreboding, of dismay rested
on all. With the exception of the Prince of Orange, all
seemed like men confused.</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret turned desperately to the secretary: "The edicts
and placards of the Inquisition, the decrees of the Council of
Trent, must be published in every village, immediately‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Vigilius rose. He had been one of Granvelle's
hottest partisans, one of the sternest upholders of the
Inquisition, one of the most uncompromising believers in
the extermination of the heretics; but now that the fiat
had gone forth, now that the die was finally cast, he was
afraid‚Äîafraid of a whole nation driven to the extreme of
agony and despair.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a long, confused, and wearisome speech he feebly
spoke for delay, for compromise, for the avoidance of
scandal and riot; in general, for further evasion of that
final issue which Philip had suddenly forced.</p>

<p class='c000'>He shook with age and sickness, his hands beat the air
with palsied movements, he altered and retracted his
words‚Äîthe burden of his speech was fear, fear and terror
obvious in every sentence.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he at last sat down, wiping the tears from his eyes,
the other councillors moved impatiently. All felt that the
moment had come; the sword so long suspended over the
Netherlands had fallen, and further procrastination was
useless.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The matter is now between the King and the people,"
said the Prince of Orange. "Put before them the King's
commands‚Äîand hear their answer."</p>

<p class='c000'>Again Margaret trembled to hear him speak; her
blurred eyes strove to pierce the fast-encroaching winter
dusk that was descending on the council chamber, so that
she might read his expression.</p>

<p class='c000'>"His Highness is right," said Egmont. "The placards
and edicts must be issued."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>"I see us all ruined," muttered Hoorne, tugging at his
black beard, "but we must obey."</p>

<p class='c000'>All agreed; no one supported Vigilius, who sat shaking
in his chair, counselling "a little delay‚Äîa little delay."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have resigned, learned President," William answered
him. "Before this storm breaks, you may be safely
in shelter."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Methinks this will be a storm from which there will be
no shelter," murmured the old man.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Speak encouraging words, or hold your peace, good
sir," cried Margaret distractedly; and turning to Armenteros
she gave the orders for the enforcement of the edicts
and placards.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one noticed the increasing darkness, which now almost
prevented them seeing each other's faces; no one heard
the sound and wrath of the storm without, the whirling of
the waters, the combat of the winds. All were listening to
the scratching of the Spaniard's quill while he took down the
instructions which were practically the death-warrants of a
whole nation; all watched him as he leant sideways to catch
the light‚Äîhim, and the white blur of the paper over which
his quill was moving.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length it was done; the Regent bent from her chair,
took the pen, and blindly signed.</p>

<p class='c000'>William of Orange drew a great breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now we shall see the beginning of the most terrible
tragedy the world has known!" he whispered to Hoorne,
and his tone was almost one of exultation, the tone of a
man who sees his enemy face to face, out in the open, at
last.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Admiral crossed himself in silence; Egmont gave a
passionate ejaculation; the rest were dumb and motionless
in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so the thing was done, and Philip's mandate obeyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret rose and called for candles; Armenteros put
up his papers; the councillors got to their feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Severally they took leave of the Regent; when the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>candles were brought in, William of Orange was at her side,
and she saw his face, pale and extraordinarily aglow with
some inner emotion.</p>

<p class='c000'>He took his leave with no added word, and she could find
none with which to detain him, though she longed to try
and test him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was on the palace steps with Lamoral Egmont at
his side; they paused a second watching the loose, fiercely
driven clouds flying over the seven churches and proud
palaces of Brussels, the long broken lances of the rain
dashing on shining wet roof and spire.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'Tis the Angel of Death riding the whirlwind‚Äîthe clouds
of havoc gather from the four corners of the earth," said
the Prince. "God send us a good deliverance."</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V<br /> THE KNIGHT-ERRANT</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>AS the Prince of Orange returned to his palace he
passed a mansion which defied the stormy night
with light and music, and from the great doors,
which emitted rays of rose and gold on to the bitter rain,
a band of young cavaliers came forth, mounted, and
turned their several ways, with joyous farewells to each
other.</p>

<p class='c000'>William recognized the persons and voices of several‚ÄîBrederode,
Hoogstraaten, Culemburg, Nicolas de Hammes,
commonly called Golden Fleece, and his own brother
Louis, who was newly come to Brussels.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince reined up his wet and steaming horse and
waited for the Count, who bared his head to the rain at
sight of his brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>"From the Council?" he asked, as he brought his
horse long-side his brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," said William briefly, and neither spoke again as,
bending before the weather, they made their way to the
Nassau palace.</p>

<p class='c000'>For once the Prince did not appear at the almost public
table he kept, but dined alone with Louis in his private
apartments.</p>

<p class='c000'>The princely chamber was warmly lit by the yellow
glow of fair wax candles; the gay tapestries, the heavy
furniture gleamed with gold; among the crystal and lace
of the dining-table gold shone too, and in the brocade
of the chairs and in the great heart of the fire burning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>behind the sparkling brass and irons on the wide brick
hearth.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the magnificence of their persons the two young men
were worthy of the gorgeous setting. The tawny velvet
and violet silk of the Prince's attire was drawn and purfled
with gold, the triple ruff that framed his dark face as
high as the close waves of hair above the small ears was
edged with gold lace, gold flashed again in the chain
which was twisted in heavy links round and round his neck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis wore black satin cut over yellow velvet and a
falling ruff of Malines lace; his fair and charming face
was as fresh as a flower, his eyes flashed as brightly as any
gold in the room, and the ruby clasps fastening his doublet
rose and fell with his eager and impatient breaths.</p>

<p class='c000'>William usually ate with a hearty appetite, and enjoyed the
luxurious pleasure of a richly set meal; but to-night he let
the courses pass almost untouched, and broke the pieces
upon his plate and left them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Neither did he speak much, though it was not his habit
to be taciturn. After he had given his brother a brief
account of the momentous Council he was silent.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Louis glowed with swift anger and boundless enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have not been idle," he declared. "The festivities,
the weddings of Parma and Montigny, have been a fair
pretext for our meetings. We have already a league among
ourselves."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I know something of that," answered William. "It
will be as dangerous a matter as Egmont's livery."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you bid me hold back‚Äînow?" cried Louis impetuously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I bid no man hold back," replied the Prince quietly.
"Who are with you in this design?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Brederode, Ste Aldegonde, Culemburg, Hoogstraaten,
de Hammes, Montigny‚Äîall the younger nobility‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Montigny!" said William softly, "and he has just
taken a wife."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>"Is she not a beautiful creature?" answered Louis.
"Half of those who jousted before her would have given
half their rents to win H√©l√®ne d'Espinoy. Montigny loves
his wife," he added, in a lower voice. "Did you not notice
it at the jousts?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I hope he will not go to Madrid," remarked William.
"I hear that he and Berghen think of undertaking an
embassy to Philip."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Egmont‚Äîwill he not go again?" asked Louis.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No‚Äîhe is still sore at the success of his last mission."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince rose and crossed to the hearth, resting his
elbow against the chimney-side and his face in his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis, still seated at the table, glanced at his brother
wistfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You take my news coldly," he said in a tone of disappointment.
"I thought that you would be rejoiced
to hear that there was this league to protect the rights
of the nobles and the liberties of the people."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was no news to me," answered William. "I knew
your designs. You are all young and ardent and reckless‚ÄîGod
keep you all."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis bit his lip and drank the last drop of yellow wine
that lay like liquid amber in his sparkling crystal glass.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We do what we can," he said, with great emotion,
"and none but a coward would do less at such a time
as this."</p>

<p class='c000'>William was silent; his face was turned away from his
brother and his shoulders drooped a little.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young Count flushed all over his sensitive face at
what he thought the Prince's disapproval.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rose and stood before the brilliant disorder of the
dining-table in the attitude of a man justifying himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>His ardent gaiety had gone; he was passionately grave,
passionately in earnest.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If Your Highness will not support me in what I do,
I must go on alone. I too am one of these doomed
people, I too am a heretic. I am one of those whom the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Church and Philip have thrice cursed, thrice damned;
and every poor artisan whose flesh smokes above the
market-place, and every wandering preacher who is tortured
to death, is my brother in God. I cannot speak of these
things without tears. We may tourney and dance and
feast, but the nation is bleeding to death from a thousand
wounds, and I cannot go on in my own easy safety‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is not your country, Louis, nor your quarrel."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, it is my quarrel," returned the young Count
eagerly, "because I too am a heretic. This cause I espouse,
to this quarrel I devote myself."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are knight-errant," said the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis flushed again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, I am nothing but a poor soldier, as which I shall
live and die."</p>

<p class='c000'>William suddenly moved so as to face him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"How far will you go?" he demanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>"As far as any."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Would you take up arms against the King?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"With all my heart and, I think, God's blessing,"
answered the young man gravely. "If Egmont should
lead a rising against the King‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Egmont!" said William quickly. "Egmont never will‚ÄîEgmont
is a good Catholic. Egmont is loyal to Philip."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Even now?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Even now‚Äîhe is not the man of this moment."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Brederode will lead us, then," replied Louis.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Brederode is reckless, imprudent‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is popular, loyal, brave. Then there is Ste Aldegonde‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Another fiery spirit‚Äîa poet, too!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Culemburg, then De Hammes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Too low in rank‚Äîyou yourself are better suited than
any of these."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis replied soberly‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I am called, I am willing to serve‚Äîto the death."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I know," said William, "I know."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Louis stood doubtful, distressed, his brown fingers pulling
nervously at the edge of the fine tablecloth.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Would you not be willing for me to take this charge
upon myself?" he asked earnestly and imploringly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince did not reply; his face seemed drained of
blood beneath the brown skin, his dark eyes were black
with the dilation of the pupils.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And you, you?" urged Louis. "What will you do?
Bow the neck to Philip?"</p>

<p class='c000'>He moved away from the table, crushing his hands together.</p>

<p class='c000'>William turned now and spoke; he made an effort
with his words. Choosing them carefully, arranging them
exactly, often faltering in the endeavour to force his wide
and far-reaching thoughts into speech; in all he said
was great patience, great sincerity, great gentleness.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You must not think me cold. Indeed I am not cold.
I know Spain and Philip better than you‚Äîbetter than your
friends. I know his power, his resources, his persistency‚Äîabove
all his power! 'Tis the King of half the world.
And now he has spoken, he will not go back from his word.
Do you think the Regent will long serve his turn? Before
this present crisis she will fail utterly. A dull woman.
Philip will send Alva and an army‚Äîthe finest army in the
world, Louis. It was Alva who advised this stern decree.
I know that‚Äîa great soldier, the Duke of Alva, a loyal
Catholic‚Äîhe will come. Nothing will stop Philip now.
No laws, no charters, no promises‚Äîhe has condemned to
death the Netherlands, and he will not fail to send the
executioner."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis listened intently, one hand pressing the ruby
buttons on his breast, his eyes eagerly on his brother's
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have been like a watchman over this land since
King Henry spoke to me in Vincennes wood. I have seen
havoc and ruin and desolation coming nearer and nearer,"
continued the Prince mournfully; "I see it very near now.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>I see this country overwhelmed as if the dikes had been
cut down and the sea were rushing in‚Äîa flood no man can
withstand‚Äîand do you think I wish to see all I love dash
forward vainly, to be swept away by the first wave of this
deluge? Ah, Louis," he added, in a tone of anguish,
"what is your defiance against Philip's might‚Äîwhat are
all the gentlemen of Flanders against Alva's army? But a
stone in the way to be flung aside and forgotten."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Are we, then, to submit?" asked Louis in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince took a restless turn about the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Philip is not to be defeated by knight-errantry, but by
subtle ways, like to his own‚Äîby policy, by patience, by
long years of endeavour and waiting. He is not to be met
openly in the field, but snared in secret places."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Meanwhile, we shall grow old and palsied," cried
Louis, "and all the hot blood in us will go for nothing."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You see the glory of the combat, I see the anguish of
the defeat," said William slowly. "You remember the
skryer in Leipsic? How he saw the future in the crystal‚Äîand
the end, all blood and blackness? To me too it seems
like that‚Äîdarkness ahead and death‚Äîthe sacrifice of all
our house."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Speak words of good import," cried the Count. "Why
should God utterly forsake us? Will He not set high the
standard of the good cause?"</p>

<p class='c000'>William looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yea, if one gave all one had, if one suffered and waited,
if one sacrificed‚Äîall‚Äîfor what one dared to think the right,
perhaps God might help one‚ÄîGod! But doth He help,
or rather leave us to depend on our own poor energies?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis was startled by the emotion in his brother's voice,
by the look of his pallid face on which the dews of anguish
had started.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you mean? What will you do?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not know," said William. "I do not know. I
say I see it all dark ahead‚Äîlast night the stars were red
and flashing through the blackness of hideous clouds, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>methought it needed no great fancy to believe these tales
of spectral battalions who nightly combat in the skies and
rain blood upon the earth. Two days ago at Leyden the
sentries felt warm blood upon their hands and heard the
shouts of battle overhead."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis shuddered.</p>

<p class='c000'>"At Utrecht and Haarlem they saw armed men fighting
in the air," he answered; "one told the very pattern of the
flint-locks and the manner of caps they wore."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I would consult my skryer," smiled William sadly,
"but the strange rogue has left me on the sudden.
And we need no skryer to warn us of what is before us, and
no portents in the air to prepare us."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And I, what must I do?" asked Louis, with a noble and
winning deference to the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Wait," replied the Prince. "Wait‚Äîpersuade the
others to do so too. Put no other check upon yourselves
but prudence‚Äîbe secret, take only those on whom you can
rely into your League‚Äîwatch Ste Aldegonde, Brederode,
and de Hammes; they are too reckless‚Äîdo not trust
Charles Mansfeld‚Äîrely on Hoogstraaten and Culemburg‚Äî‚ÄîAh,
what can I say!" He passionately caught
the young Count by the shoulders. "I leave it to your
own heart, your own judgment; but remember that you
will be needed, do not fling yourself away."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Princely brother," answered Louis, and the tears stood
in his eyes, "I am always at your service, and only ask
leave to die at your feet."</p>

<p class='c000'>William kissed him on the brow, then releasing him,
drew from the gilded pocket that hung at his own waist
a curious iron ring set with a large opal the colour of milk,
and holding blood and fire in the heart.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Wear this," said the Prince. "It is an Eastern talisman
which shall protect you from evil."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis slipped it on his signet finger.</p>

<p class='c000'>"When another than myself brings you this, you will
know that I am dead," he smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>"God grant that I may never see it save on your hand!"
exclaimed the Prince. "And now I give you leave to go‚Äîyou
are due at Hoogstraaten's supper?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes; will you not come?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not to-night‚Äîmy duty to all. Until to-morrow,
adieu."</p>

<p class='c000'>They touched hands again, and each looked at the
other with a certain wistfulness, as if their hearts were full
of a yearning affection they did not dare express.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Louis had gone William returned to the fire,
which was falling into ashes at the edges.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of all the conversation with his brother one phrase
suddenly leapt to his mind unbidden; he seemed to
read it in the dying heart of the flame‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Montigny loves his wife."</p>

<p class='c000'>The four words gave the Prince a strange pang in the
remembrance; he crossed the room and looked at a little
painting of Anna van Buren, the first Princess of Orange,
which hung on the opposite wall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pale prim face, her gentle eyes, her drooping mouth,
the very dress she wore, and the jewel round her neck
which he had given‚Äîhe recalled her so clearly‚Äîeven as
she was painted now‚Äîyet how remote she was; she
had made no impression on his life, and he never thought
of her now save as he might think of some playmate of
his youth‚Äîfor they had been married at seventeen, and
she had died almost before he had reached full manhood;
but she had been to him what the wives of most great
nobles were to their husbands‚Äîa little more than the
wives of Hoorne and Brederode were to them, a little
less than Egmont's wife was to him. In the misery and
humiliation of his present marriage he could recall her
gratefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>But love‚Äî"Montigny <em>loves</em> his wife"‚Äîthe words came
again to him like the echo in a shell held to the ear, and
sounded sadly in the loneliness of the Prince's heart.
"If a man had great difficulties and a hard and toilsome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>task, a loving wife would be a marvellous comfort," he
thought. Then he laughed at his own fancies. "A man
must not depend on women. There are things to be
done in which no woman can help."</p>

<p class='c000'>He went to the window, opened the shutters and looked
out upon the storm.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rain had ceased, and the bitter winds were tearing
the black clouds apart and hurling them across the
heavens; the curled thread of the new moon glimpsed
here and there amid the vapours like a frail barque amid
the wreckage of a hideous sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fair fields of Brabant and the proud gay town of
Brussels were blotted out in the darkness, but a faint
strain of melody rose fitfully on the winds: it was the
carillon from some hidden clock tower.</p>

<p class='c000'>William of Orange stood silent, holding the window
casement open with either hand and listening to the
storm that for him held the sound of gathering armies,
the tramp of feet, the galloping of horses, the flapping
of banners straining at their poles‚Äîthe coming of great
multitudes onrushing in the agony and the exultation of
supreme conflict.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI<br /> THE EDICTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Throughout the Netherlands the Inquisition
was again formally and officially proclaimed; it
was answered by a cry of passionate wrath and
hate, and bitter despair and agony, intense enough to
have reached Philip in the cells of the Escorial.</p>

<p class='c000'>Foreign merchants and workers fled, houses of business
were shut up, shops closed, banks ruined; commerce‚Äînay,
the ordinary business of life‚Äîwas almost suspended;
whole districts emigrated, abandoning their work and
their property. In a short time famine threatened, riots
broke out, and the daily barbarous executions were scenes
of frantic rage on the part of the maddened population
which the officers of the Crown sometimes found it difficult
or impossible to repress; more than once the victims
were rescued from the very stake.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brabant hotly protested that the introduction of the
Inquisition was illegal and expressly against the distinct
provisions of "the joyous entry," and the four principal
cities came forward with a petition to Margaret which
she could not ignore. The matter was referred to the
Council of Brabant; even the creatures of the Government
had to admit that no ecclesiastical tribunal had ever
been allowed jurisdiction in Brabant, and the great province
was declared free of the Inquisition‚Äîwith the result that
it was soon overcrowded with desperate refugees from all
other parts of the ravaged Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pasquils, lampoons, open letters issued by the thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>from the secret presses, and every morning saw fresh
ones pasted on the gates of the great nobles in Brussels.
Egmont and Orange, as the most powerful and most
popular nobles, were passionately called upon to come
forward and protect the country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor did these people‚Äîmiddle-class artisans, weavers,
tanners, dyers, printers, carvers, merchants, shop-keepers,
farmers, all the great mass of the population, the industrious,
sober, quiet men who were slowly building
up the prosperity of the country‚Äîlack for generous
championship, even from those nobles who were Catholics.</p>

<p class='c000'>Baron Montigny, in the first flush of his joyous
marriage, the Marquis Berghen, who had always been
unflinching in his refusal to acknowledge the Inquisition,
the younger Mansfeld, refused to enforce the Edicts within
their provinces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont lent his authority to the work of persecution
in Flanders, but Orange declined to support the Inquisition
within his Stadtholderships.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile Louis of Nassau was consolidating the
famous Compromise or League of which he and Ste
Aldegonde had laid the foundations during their meeting
at Spa, and which had been joined by a considerable
number of the younger nobility; while Hoorne
and Orange, Hoogstraaten and Montigny, had been
jousting in the lists at the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ch√¢teau</span> d'Antoine before
the beautiful bride, H√©l√®ne d'Espinoy, Louis and Ste
Aldegonde were going from tent to tent, from cavalier
to cavalier, laughing, jesting, and secretly obtaining
promises of signatures to the Compromise, which consisted
of a vow to resist "the tyranny of foreigners, and
especially the Holy Inquisition, as contrary to all laws
human and divine, and the mother of all iniquity and
disorder."</p>

<p class='c000'>By early in the new year, the energies of Louis and
Ste Aldegonde, both of whom had been active during
the extravagant marriage feasts of the proud Parma
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Prince, had secured over two thousand signatures from
the younger nobility.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great nobles and Stadtholders they did not attempt
to approach; the secret Compromise, being so zealously
passed from one eager young hand to another, was scarcely
a document anyone in authority could sign.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Montigny and Berghen knew of the League, and
were prepared to protect the members; the Prince of
Orange, if he did not openly encourage, at least made no
effort to check the ardent labours of his brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>The full details of the scheme, nor the heights of daring
to which the covenanters had gone, were not disclosed to
him; Louis feared the disapproval of the Prince's wise
patience, and the other young nobles were even doubtful
as to which side His Highness would ultimately espouse,
so delicately did his discretion hold the balance, so completely
was every one in the dark as to his final intentions.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the very day of the Parma wedding, while the
princely couple were being united with the full magnificence
of the rites of the Catholic Church, twenty gentlemen of the
Reformed Faith gathered in the house of Count Culemburg
on the horse market and listened to the preaching of a
famous Huguenot, Francis Junius, the pastor of a secret
congregation at Antwerp. This man, young, brave,
eloquent, already in hiding, combined with Louis of
Nassau to draw up a petition or protest to the Government
on the ever-important subject of the Edicts.</p>

<p class='c000'>So came in the first stormy months of the year 1566.</p>

<p class='c000'>The price of grain rose to hitherto unheard-of figures,
for the ground was untilled, the harvests unsown; all
business with foreign lands was at a standstill, for no
stranger would venture into a country which lay under
such a ban, nor trust their goods in Dutch ports. Industry
was paralysed; the great busy cities, formerly some of
the finest and busiest in the world, were silent, deserted,
and desolate under the monstrous tyranny which had
overwhelmed them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>The Inquisitors-General, De Bay and Tiletanus, had
received personal letters of encouragement from the King;
Peter Titelmann too received the Royal praise; and the
three continued their work of horror and terror, agony
and blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards the beginning of the year Berghen resigned
his posts, pleading his inability to obey His Majesty in the
matter of religion; Meghem soon followed his example;
Egmont lamented that he had not resigned all his offices
when in Spain‚Äî"As he would have done," he declared,
"had he known what His Majesty's intentions were."</p>

<p class='c000'>He, however, maintained his official position, and continued
to behave with severity against the heretics in
Flanders; so he vacillated, pleasing neither the nobles
nor the Regent, neither of whom dared rely on him.</p>

<p class='c000'>William addressed a letter of remonstrance and protest
to the Duchess, plainly avowing his views, pointing to the
state of the land, and condemning the policy of the King.</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret, in despair, wrote to Philip, putting all these
things before him, and beseeching him to reconsider the
decision with regard to the Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Philip did not answer, and William of Orange, who did
not lack spies in Madrid, knew why: the King was preparing
the levies with which Alva was to try his hand at
bringing the rebellious Netherlands to subjection.</p>

<p class='c000'>But if Philip was making busy preparations in secret,
William was not inactive; still hoping by calm and
patience to avert the worst of the disaster that still
threatened‚Äîthe arrival, namely, of Alva's army‚Äîhe summoned
a meeting of the nobles and grandees at Breda,
and in a series of conferences, disguised as hunting parties,
endeavoured to bring all to concur in some reasonable
petition to be presented to the Regent, the main scope of
which was to be an appeal for the convocation of the
States-General.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this project was too daring for the loyal nobles
and too quiet for the leaguers; the conferences ended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>with no result, save that of sending Meghem, alarmed and
disgusted by the violence of the younger nobles, definitely
over to the side of the Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, soon after Meghem announced to Margaret his
discovery of a widespread conspiracy among the heretics,
who were ready, he declared, to the number of thirty-five
thousand armed men to march against Brussels, and he
placed before the Regent a copy of the Compromise.</p>

<p class='c000'>These extravagant statements were supported by Egmont,
who declared that there were great tumults preparing
among the heretics, and that the Government must act
without delay.</p>

<p class='c000'>The alarm of the Regent was intense and was scarcely
soothed by the Prince of Orange's calm recital of the
sober truth‚Äînamely, that a great number of nobles and
gentlemen were coming to Brussels to lay a petition or
request at the feet of the Regent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meeting after meeting of councillors, of grandees, of
Knights of the Golden Fleece, were now held, while the question
was hotly argued whether or no the covenanters were
to be suffered to present their petition‚Äîthe Prince of
Orange claiming that they were entitled to all respect;
Meghem, Aremberg, and Barlaymont insisting that the
palace doors should be closed in their faces. The case
grew so desperate that the Duchess proposed to fly to
Mons, and was only with difficulty persuaded to hold her
post.</p>

<p class='c000'>As to the petitioners, it was decided they should be
admitted, but unarmed; the guards at the city gates being
strengthened to prevent any armed followers gaining the
entrance to the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brussels ran mad with joy at this concession; it was
almost as if the Inquisition had been abolished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Margaret of Parma, sick with agitation and dread,
shut herself up in her chamber and wept by the hour
together. To her brother she wrote that the time had
now come to either use force or withdraw the Inquisition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>and the Edicts. Philip, intent on gathering together Alva's
army, kept his sister in an agony of suspense, and neither
let her know that her successor was already preparing to
take her place, nor that he had finally decided to crush
the Netherlands under the weight of the secular sword,
since the spiritual authority of the Inquisition had failed.</p>

<p class='c000'>All through the tumultuous, anxious days, March
sweetening into April, R√©n√®e le Meung watched the
comings and goings of the Prince from the window of her
high little chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in the morning she would be awake and watching
till the hour when he rode forth. Well she came to know
that early view of Brussels wrapt in the blue haze of
morning with the gleam of the faint spring sun on the twin
towers of Ste Gudule; well did she come to know the
figure of the man she watched for, his way of sitting the
saddle, the trick of throwing his cloak, the fashion of
touching up his horse as he passed the gates.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes he did not come before she was called to her
duties, and the vigil would have been in vain; sometimes
she was not able to get back to her post before he returned;
but there was hardly a day passed that she did not contrive
to see him once‚Äîif it was only that distant glimpse.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had not spoken to him since he had caught the
pigeon for her, and her days were now entirely occupied
with Anne, whose melancholy and fury daily increased.
Since Dupr√®s and all appertaining to him had left the
palace, the Princess hated R√©n√®e with a bitter, cowering
hate that sometimes cringed and sometimes threatened
and sometimes railed, and at all times made life a torment
for the waiting-woman‚Äîa torment which was only endurable
because of those moments when she could escape to
her room, and perhaps also because of some inner and
consoling conviction that she was standing at the post of
duty, and that perhaps in the great events, the terrible
events so rapidly shaping, she too might take a not unworthy
part.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>The very spring itself seemed sad that year; the green on
the trees, the violets and daffodils in the Prince's gardens
brought no joyousness with them; the low winds were laden
with melancholy; the long pale days, the chill nights, the
cloudless sunsets, the cold dawns held no comfort nor cheer.</p>

<p class='c000'>In R√©n√®e's mind, as in the mind of every other man and
woman of the Netherlands, was the thought of the fires in
the market-places, of the daily hideous executions, of the
cries of agony and despair, bereavement and madness
rising from every town, from every village; of the exiles
fleeing to England, carrying with them their skill, their
knowledge, which was the wealth of the nation; of broken
fields and unsown harvests, of children starving and lamenting
in the streets. She thought of the great, magnificent
churches all over the land, where every day costly and
solemn ritual was performed, and where in the grave, rich
gloom of sanctified beauty, gorgeous music, gorgeous
vestures, the loveliness of art, the splendour of texture,
marble, silk, tapestry, coloured glass, crystal, gold, jewels
were all dedicated to the service of the God to Whom were
sent up the flames of the living torches which lit the market-place,
to Whom was offered the blood of maids and boys,
mothers and children who had no sin beyond their steadfastness
to the Truth as they believed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And still He makes no sign," thought R√©n√®e. "And
still He sends none‚Äîangel nor man‚Äîto smite and deliver."</p>

<p class='c000'>When the first days of April came, she saw the Confederates,
headed by Brederode and Count Louis, go past
the Orange palace on their entry into Brussels; the two
leaders halted with the Prince, who was entertaining them,
and R√©n√®e, leaning from the window, heard Brederode say
as he crossed the courtyard, "Eh, well, here I am, and
perhaps I shall depart in another manner."</p>

<p class='c000'>The splendour of the Nassau mansion was no longer what
it had been, though it was still magnificent. Richly
appointed tables no longer stood ready for all comers at all
hours of the day and night; the great number of servants
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>was reduced; there were fewer balls, concerts, and feasts;
the Prince bought no more tapestries, pictures, statues,
rare books, nor costly plants; the jewel and the silk merchants
no longer waited every morning in his antechamber,
nor were vast sums any longer expended on hawks and
hounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>But for these two guests a generous welcome was prepared,
and William himself met them on the stairs, kissing
each on either cheek.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e crept back to Anne, who sat among her German
women, lamenting, complaining against her husband,
against the Netherlands, against her own miserable fate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The child played at her knee, but she regarded it with
utter indifference. R√©n√®e picked up the little girl and
carried her away; the sound of the Princess's voice travelled
across the apartments.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Am I to be ruined for a parcel of heretics? Curse the
day of my birth, curse my marriage day!"</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>The third day of April, which dawned over Brussels
fair as refined silver, found R√©n√®e at her post, leaning
from her narrow window, its harsh stone frame
serving as a sombre setting for her face, so unconsciously
beautiful and so sadly serene.</p>

<p class='c000'>She saw the Prince ride away with his gentlemen; the
long green cloak in which he was wrapped could not quite
conceal the glitter of the Order of the Golden Fleece
flaming on his breast.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e knew that he was going to attend the Regent in
Council, for this was the day that the Confederates or
Covenanters, as they were severally named, were to
present their Petition to Madame Parma; and to-day,
instead of going downstairs to her duties beside Anne,
R√©n√®e put on a hood and cloak of black cloth over her
white linen whimple and her dark yellow gown, and went
from the palace and out through the great gates into the
street.</p>

<p class='c000'>She allowed herself this much advantage from the secret
hold she had over Anne‚Äîthis one day's holiday; the
night before she had told her mistress of her intention, and
Anne had said nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was strange to be in the streets after the long confinement
in the palace and the palace gardens; it was
strange to be one of the people, amidst the ordinary life of
a great city, after having been so long merely part of the
machinery of a princely establishment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>R√©n√®e received a sense of energy, of hope, of courage in
thus finding herself free and one of the crowd. She wished
she could learn some trade or art by which she could earn
her own living; but she was too old to be taken as an
apprentice, and even were she not, she had not sufficient
money to keep herself while she acquired it, nor one friend
or relation to whom she could appeal to help her.</p>

<p class='c000'>No, there was no means of life open to R√©n√®e but the one
she was following, especially in these times of ruin and
panic, when so many people were out of work, and those
who had money were clutching it tight.</p>

<p class='c000'>But she was not one to be daunted even by hopeless
difficulties; she asked so little of life, cared so little when
it ended, that if she had been considering only herself she
would have left Anne's service and tried to find another
great lady to take her, or have gone as a servant into some
Protestant family. But she stayed with Anne because to
wait on his wife, to control her, to soften her furies, to
check her excesses, was the sole poor unknown service she
could render the man for whom she would have gladly done
anything.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now that she knew Anne's sordid and shameful
secret, she had a power, an influence over her such as none
other possessed, and could restrain her and bring her to
some reason when all else had failed. The Prince might
entreat his wife to appear on some state occasion, and she
would rudely refuse; but when R√©n√®e insisted, she would
suffer herself to be attired and go.</p>

<p class='c000'>So with a sigh R√©n√®e relinquished her fleeting dreams
of freedom and a sane, wholesome life among her own
people.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she moved further into the city she felt with overmastering
pain how lonely she was, how unutterably
lonely; all the companies she passed‚Äîwomen together,
families, men with their wives and sisters‚Äîemphasized the
terrible feeling of her loneliness.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it had not been for Philip and the Holy Inquisition, her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>life would not have been broken, her heart seared; she
would have been as one of these; she would have had
parents, money, position, friends, probably a lover‚Äîin a
word, happiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she remembered that she was only one of thousands
left desolate‚Äîperhaps more desolate than she was;
fifty thousand, she had heard, had died under the Inquisition
and the Edicts, and how many aching, maddened
hearts had each of these deaths left behind? R√©n√®e felt
rebuked in her complaint of her loneliness; she shuddered
as she went down the hill to the church of Ste Gudule‚Äîshuddered
though the spring breezes were soft and the
spring sun warm.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the steps of the church she paused and looked down
at the city lying in the hollow of the hills, all the spires and
vanes of the Town Hall and the palace, of the various guilds
in the market-place rising delicate and erect into the pale
and pure sky, while on all the irregular tumbled-looking
roofs and gables the sun changed lead to gold and casement
glass to diamonds.</p>

<p class='c000'>She turned, lifted the heavy curtain at the low door
in the greater door, and entered the church whose twin
towers she had watched so constantly that they had come
to mean to her the Papist power which dominated the
land.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had not been in a Romish church since she was a child
and had crept into the great church of St. Baron at Ghent.
She had not meant to enter this now, but a fascinated sense
of horror drew her on‚Äîhorror because she could not
regard this faith with toleration; it stood to her for an
epitome of idolatry, cruelty, wickedness, oppression, and
uncharitableness.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was not a Protestant by chance; her whole
nature detested the Church of Rome. She stepped
forward into the gloom, pulling her hood further over her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first she could distinguish nothing but the seven thick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>wax candles burning on the altar and the red lamps flickering
their eternal light before the shrines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then from the mystical shadows began to loom the
shapes of pillars, massive, yet so dimly coloured as to seem
impalpable, as if they were beneath the sea; brocades,
marbles, altars set with jasper, silver, and chrysolite became
visible in the side chapels, here and there the rapt faces of
angels showed from some dark painting on the wall, the air
was redolent of the incense, the wax smoke, and the scent of
flowers. This mingled perfume was near as ancient as the
church, which had remained for so long enclosed from the
light and air that it seemed as if built underground.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such light as there was streamed richly from the
coloured glass windows where saints and bishops blazed
together in wheels and panels of glory.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e fixed her eyes on the High Altar which was
flushed with a shadow like golden-red wine, in the middle of
which the flat, gold, ruby-studded doors of the shrine that
held the Eucharist flashed and shone like the Eye of God
itself. Beyond, the pillars and arches of the Lady Chapel
rose up dim, and appearing of a translucent quality in the
shade which here, flushed with the light from gold-coloured
windows, was sea-green and amber behind the crimson
of the altar.</p>

<p class='c000'>Round the huge candlesticks of dark red Florentine
copper were alabaster bowls, almost transparent, veined
with violet, which held the first lilies of the year in sweet
clusters‚Äîthe lilies from wood and field called Easter lilies
from the time of their coming.</p>

<p class='c000'>The church was empty save for here and there the dark
bent figure of a peasant before some side altar.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e could not bring herself to bend the knee before
the idols her father had perished to disown, and, with a
trembling in her limbs as if some physical power had
seized her and a choking in her throat as if the sweet thick
air was poisonous, she turned and fled quickly into the pale
sunshine without.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>The excited people were already beginning to gather to
watch the passing of the petitioners on their way to the
palace.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e did not know which way the procession was to
pass, and she was largely ignorant of the city, but she
followed the direction in which the great mass of the
crowd was going.</p>

<p class='c000'>She particularly noticed this crowd and its demeanour,
the soberness, the earnestness, the silence of these
people.</p>

<p class='c000'>None of them seemed to be treating the occasion as a
festival or as a holiday, if they showed a certain satisfaction
it was grave and serious; very few of them were
armed, and all of them were restrained in gestures and
speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were some gentry, on foot and on horse, but the
great number were burghers, traders, and apprentices
belonging to the seven great guilds of Brussels.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e following in the wake of this crowd climbed the
hill again, left the towers of Ste Gudule below, and came
out on the heights above the town where stood the parks
and mansions of the great nobles, and the Brabant palace
which was the residence of the Regent.</p>

<p class='c000'>As she passed the palace R√©n√®e caught sight of the spare
figure and excited face of the skryer Dupr√®s, as he pushed
his way through the crowd.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e was disgusted to think the man was still in
Brussels; she had hoped that he would find it wise to
leave the Netherlands, or at least the town; but probably
he had given up his dangerous occupation of rhetoric
player and, with the spoils of the Nassau mansion, had
established himself as a respectable Papist.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now a great movement shook the crowd, a low hum
rose from the throats of the men, and the women began to
tiptoe excitedly and to lift their little children to their
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e was at the back and could see nothing, but two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>men who had a point of vantage on the steps of a mansion
near by gravely helped her up beside them.</p>

<p class='c000'>One asked her if she was a Fleming?</p>

<p class='c000'>"My father was hanged for a heretic in Ghent,"
answered R√©n√®e, "and I am in the service of the Prince of
Orange."</p>

<p class='c000'>It gave her pleasure to mention the Prince and not his
wife; and it was truly <em>his</em> service in which she was.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two men took off their caps to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Spaniards will not hang many more Netherlanders,"
one remarked; and they supported R√©n√®e against the
balustrade of the steps so that she could see over the heads
of the closely packed people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the humming changed into a clapping of
hands and a deep shouting that made R√©n√®e's blood
tingle with excitement and deep emotion; she pushed
back the hood from her flushed face and gazed at the
procession which now appeared marching up the street
and turning in at the splendid gates of the palace.</p>

<p class='c000'>All were on foot and unarmed, all were nobles, many
of the highest rank, and all were young and gorgeously
attired, so that it was a magnificent procession, such as
all the great festivals of Brussels had not seen before,
which now wound under the portals of the Brabant
palace.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He who goes first," said the man next to R√©n√®e, "is
Philip de Billeuel."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And some think it an ill augury that he should be
lame," remarked the other doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e had indeed remarked that the young nobleman
who led the petitioners halted unmistakably.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And he in the black and blue," added her informant,
straining his voice to make it heard above the clapping
and the shouting‚Äî"with the look of fire, who is answering
the cries of the people‚Äîis Nicolas de Hammes whom
they call Golden Fleece, and he behind in the sable cloak
is Ste Aldegonde‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>R√©n√®e had already recognized these two as well as
several others whom she had seen at the Nassau palace,
and as the rich and brilliant company of gentlemen
passed before her, there were several of the eager, proud,
young faces she knew as related to some of the noblest
families of the land.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enthusiasm of the crowd became almost piteous
in its eager gratitude to these nobles who were making
themselves the champions of the people and protesting
so openly and in such an imposing fashion against the
loathed Spaniards and the loathed Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Encouraging shouts, adjurations, blessings, and thanks
were showered on the petitioners, and some of the more
reckless, as Golden Fleece and Ste Aldegonde, replied
by shouting curses on the Inquisition and the Cardinalists.
R√©n√®e recognized Count Culemburg and Count van der
Berg, the Prince of Orange's brother-in-law, glittering
in French brocades and Genoese velvet and great chains
about their necks and round their hats.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally, closing the procession, came the two leaders‚ÄîHenry
Brederode and Louis of Nassau.</p>

<p class='c000'>They walked alone, arm in arm, the last of all, and
for them the affectionate greetings of the crowd arose
to a frenzy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Count Brederode looked fitted to be the hero of such
a moment: his tall and noble figure, his military carriage,
his handsome face flushed with pleasure and triumph,
his eyes sparkling with a reckless fire, the full locks of
blond hair streaming on to his falling ruff, gave him the
kingly presence of a leader of men.</p>

<p class='c000'>He wore a suit of rose cloth of silver, and a great mantle
of peacock-coloured velvet; in his high black hat was a
long heron's feather clasped by a diamond.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beside his grandeur Louis of Nassau looked very slight
and youthful; he was more soberly dressed in dark blood
red, with a great ruff of many points rising up above his
face.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>And whereas Brederode appeared mightily at his ease
and greatly pleased with his task and his reception, Louis
held himself more modestly and looked grave and even
anxious; but there was about him a gallantry almost
moving.</p>

<p class='c000'>And so the last of them went into the palace, and the
crowd broke up and stayed about in groups, talking
eagerly together in excited voices while they waited for
the reappearance of the petitioners.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e wandered into a side street and entered a baker's
shop which was filled with tired women and children.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waiting-woman bought bread and cake and a kind
of sweetmeat, and while she ate she listened to the conversation
that flowed round her like many currents of
the one river.</p>

<p class='c000'>For the theme was always the same: the executions,
the torturings, the ruin falling on trade and work.</p>

<p class='c000'>And all spoke soberly without laughter or jest, and
many had eyes swollen and frayed from weeping.</p>

<p class='c000'>One only was unconcerned: a small child who stood
in a world of his own, oblivious to the talk of death and
ruin crossing above his head, while his eyes were fixed
with an eager smiling look on the piece of sweetmeat
R√©n√®e held.</p>

<p class='c000'>She found something marvellous and yet terrible in
this utter absorption of the child in his own thoughts,
in his calm, and his pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>She put the sweet into his hand and left the shop.</p>

<p class='c000'>For more than an hour she wandered about the streets,
and, when she made her way back to the Brabant palace,
the petitioners were beginning to leave.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reports of their audience, that had been passed from
soldiers and servants within the palace to those without,
were already rife among the crowd and eagerly repeated
from one to the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Regent had wept when Brederode had made his
speech, the tears had run down her face while the famous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Compromise was read, and when all the members of the
deputation had come forward, one by one, to make the
"caroale" before the Duchess as a mark of respect, and
she had thus had time to severally note their appointments,
their importance, and their number, her agitation
had increased so that Barlaymont had tried to reassure
her: "What, Madame," he had said, "do you fear these
beggars, who do not know enough to manage their own
estates and then must needs prate of state affairs? Had
I my way they should leave the palace quicker than
they came!" This the Cardinalist was reported to have
uttered loudly enough to reach the ears of some of the
gentlemen, who repeated it among themselves with wrath
and indignation.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e waited until the Prince came from the palace;
he rode out of the gates with Egmont, looking unhappy
and troubled, at his side. The two grandees were greeted
less warmly than the confederates. As neither had openly
sided with the people, and as Egmont, at least, was a
strict Catholic and something of a persecutor, they were
not so popular as they had been in the days when they
caused the downfall of Cardinal Granvelle.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e stood in the roadway, where the passing of the
Prince cast dust on her gown; she had one glimpse of
his dark ardent face and he was gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly she felt very tired; the strangeness, the
unnaturalness of her life, without home or ties, without
friends or interests or diversions, and always supervised
by a dull and ceaseless tyranny, weighed on her with the
horror of tragedy. And this deep concealed passion, this
strong faith, this devotion that lit this dreary life like a
beacon on a desert was not in the nature of comfort,
nay, rather it was a light that lit up dullness, dreariness,
and barrenness which darkness would have mercifully
concealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had not all the suppressed feeling in her breast turned
to this worship, she might have been happier, for she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>would not have known so keenly what she lacked; as it
was she knew not even the peace of apathy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Clouds were gathering over the April sky as she returned
to the palace; every one talked of the Petition and what
success it was likely to have; the streets were all filled
with murmurs of hope, of doubt, of eagerness, and of
expectation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> THE BANQUET</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Twice more in the ensuing days did Brederode and
his following present themselves at the Brabant
palace, the first time to receive the Petition which
was returned to them with Margaret's answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Madame Parma, as usual, referred everything to the
King; the Petition should be forwarded to His Majesty,
from whose well-known clemency there was everything
to be hoped.</p>

<p class='c000'>As for herself, she had no authority to suspend the
Inquisition nor the Edicts, but she would give orders to
the Inquisitors to behave with discretion; meanwhile she
adjured the petitioners to act as men loyal to King and
Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brederode's third audience was for the purpose of
answering this not very satisfactory concession; he urged
the Regent to cease all religious persecution until the
decision of the King arrived, to which Her Highness
replied she could not go beyond her former answer, but
that Count Hoogstraaten should show them the instructions
to the Inquisitors, commanding them to moderation.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was nothing more to be obtained from Madame
Parma, and the confederates separated with such hopes
as they were able to cherish, and such expectations of the
good results of Margaret's letter to the King as their knowledge
of Philip allowed them to entertain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The evening of the day that Brederode had been for
the last time to the Brabant palace, the Prince of Orange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>was dining with Mansfeld, who was sick with an inflamed
eye; his companions were Egmont and Hoorne, and the
four nobles discussed with gloom and foreboding the
situation which Brederode and his fellow-petitioners had
taken with such reckless gaiety.</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont was the most uneasy of all; the memory of
his late visit to Spain and how deftly Philip had twisted
him to his will still rankled in his mind. He had seen that
the King had not kept one of the lavish promises he had
then made, yet the Count, though conscious of being
fooled (he had utterly refused to go again to Madrid),
yet could not wholly disbelieve in Philip nor bring himself
to any action that might seem disloyal to His Majesty.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had refused to associate himself in any way with
Brederode's party, and he was one of the few Stadtholders
who obeyed Philip by using his civil authority to enforce
the decrees of the Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet he saw as well as any man the utter ruin to which
Philip's policy was bringing the Netherlands; his Brussels
palace was full of refugee heretics, and he was still regarded
by the people as their hero and their possible champion.</p>

<p class='c000'>He even ventured now to predict possible concession
as the result of the forwarding of the Request or Petition
to Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>William glanced at him with smiling eyes in a manner
that brought the blood to Egmont's cheek.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You speak against your own wit," remarked the Prince
quietly. "You <em>know</em> that the King will not be moved
from his purpose by the Petition of these young men, led
by such as Brederode."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It were better for all," interposed Count Hoorne
sourly, "if Brederode had kept out of politics."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Politics?" smiled William. "Poor Brederode knows
little of politics! But he is brave and loyal, Count; I can
conceive good uses for Brederode."</p>

<p class='c000'>"His present uses," said Egmont bitterly, "seem to be
to embroil us all. You know of this banquet to-night?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>"Yes," answered Mansfeld bitterly. "My son is there‚ÄîI
would to God he were elsewhere."</p>

<p class='c000'>"There will be much treason talked," said Hoorne.
"And Brederode in wine is no better than a madman."</p>

<p class='c000'>William glanced at the clock in the corner.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We are almost due at the council chamber," he said,
rising.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You work late," remarked Mansfeld.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And to little purpose," said Hoorne, gloomily pulling
at his black beard. "Eh, Prince?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"To little purpose, truly," replied William gravely.
"The affairs of the Netherlands are settled in Philip's
Cabinet in Madrid, not in the council chamber at Brussels."</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled to himself thoughtfully and picked up his
long velvet mantle from one of the brocade chairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We will go round by the horse market," he added,
"and see how this banquet progresses."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay, I beseech you," said Mansfeld eagerly. "Keep
away from all such dangerous sport!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not sport nor pleasure," replied the Prince, "but
Hoogstraaten is there and I would bring him away. And
if the company is riotous I will disperse them," he added,
with a sure and entirely unconscious certainty of power.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mansfeld shrugged his shoulders; his inflamed and
bandaged eye irritated him, and he was deeply vexed at his
son's connexion with the confederates.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is an affair well enough for boys," he returned
peevishly‚Äî"boys and roysterers‚Äîbut the Regent's councillors
had best keep away."</p>

<p class='c000'>William knew perfectly well what Brederode's banquet
was likely to be, and how it would be regarded by the
government; he knew also that Hoogstraaten had been
persuaded to attend against his will, and wished to save
him from too deep an implication in the riots in which
the feast would undoubtedly end; nor was William
without some kindly feeling for Brederode and a desire to
check him in his dangerous recklessness.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>Hoorne disliked Brederode, but he would gladly have
done a service to the gallant Hoogstraaten, and Egmont
was always eager to curb any display against the Government,
so the three nobles, on taking leave of Mansfeld,
set out towards the Culemburg palace where Brederode
held his dangerous feast.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had no sooner dismounted and crossed the courtyard
of the mansion than the tumultuous uproar that
reached their ears more than justified their apprehensions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The banquet of the confederates had indeed degenerated
into a riot and an orgy.</p>

<p class='c000'>An argument had been raised as to what name the
party, now so loosely designated, was to be called, and at
the height of the discussion Brederode had sprung to his
feet and related what Barlaymont had said when they
first came into the presence of Madame Parma‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"'What, is Your Highness afraid of these beggars!
People of little power who cannot manage their own
estates!'"</p>

<p class='c000'>When this sarcasm of one of their greatest enemies was
repeated to them, the company, inflamed with wine, were
strung up to a fever pitch of fury at the insult which had
been offered them‚Äîall gentlemen of rank and noble blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brederode seized the moment; taking a leathern wallet
and a wooden bowl from one of his pages, he held them
aloft over the glittering feast.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Very well!" he cried. "They call us beggars! We
will make them fear that word! We will contend against
the Inquisition, and be loyal to the King until we are beggars
indeed!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He then filled the bowl with wine and drained it to the
health of the beggars.</p>

<p class='c000'>The party name was received with mad enthusiasm;
it took the humour of all present; amid yells of approval
and shouts of applause the wooden bowl was handed from
one to another and each drank to the new party name.
When the circuit of the table had been completed the bowl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>and wallet were fastened to one of the pillars which supported
the ceiling, and the rites by which the petitioners received
their new name were concluded by each member of the
company hurling some salt and bread into his goblet, and
repeating two lines of doggerel which some one's heated wits
had instantly produced‚Äî‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>This ceremony was at the height of unrestrained and
reckless merriment, furious and unlimited enthusiasm,
when the three nobles entered the banqueting hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a wild and gorgeous sight on which they looked‚Äîa
sight all of them would rather not have beheld.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the chamber in which Francis Junius had preached
to a group of young Protestant nobles on Alexander of
Parma's wedding day, but it was more suited to the
present scene of unlicensed revelry than it had been to that
sincere and ardent gathering.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ceiling and the upper portion of the walls had been
painted by an Italian artist in the precise and airy style of
decoration which adorned the Roman palaces‚Äîdelicate
scroll-work, arabesques, birds and animals interwoven
wonderfully on a ground of deep blue and burnished gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lower part of the walls were hung with tapestry of
Arras on brass rods, each panel representing a scene in the
life of Jason, and between the tapestries were pillars with
candle sconces in heavy copper and brass, fashioned as
flowers and figures, which lit the vast apartment that was
almost entirely occupied by an immense table at which
three hundred gentlemen were seated.</p>

<p class='c000'>At either end of the room, each side of the folding-doors,
stood buffets, still loaded with fruit, sweets, and wines, and
attended by pages; round the wall, at intervals, stood the
servants in groups of twos and threes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The table itself was lit by a huge lamp of rock crystal
supported by four flying harpies, half gold, and half silver,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>with wings and tails shining in red enamel. This magnificent
light illuminated the whole table and left in shadow
only the extreme centre, where stood a gorgeous piece
of confectionery, the master-effort of Count Culemburg's
cook, representing the confederacy entering the gates
of the Brabant palace, the little figures‚Äîeach of which
was a portrait‚Äîbeing moulded out of sugar, cunningly
coloured and adorned with cuttings of candied fruits.</p>

<p class='c000'>This, on the huge raised comport of embossed gold, was
untouched, but for the rest the table was in the wildest
disorder.</p>

<p class='c000'>Almost every thread of the cloth of Brussel's lace was
stained with wine; gold goblets, crystal beakers, dishes of
fruit, of cakes, of sweetmeats were scattered right and left;
at one end two young men were dancing on the table,
clinging to each other, while their unsteady feet knocked
over glasses and plates; several had mounted on the backs
of their chairs, and sat with their feet on the table edge,
while they shouted at the top of their voices; others, their
caps turned inside out and their doublets torn open, danced
about the room vowing eternal friendship to each other and
eternal fidelity to the party; a few retained their places at
the table and, with beakers at their lips, pledged again and
again the party of "the beggars"; most of them had
baptized a neighbour into the confederacy by pouring wine
over his shoulders and head, so that flushed faces, rich
clothes, and tumbled locks alike dripped red.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole scene seemed coloured red‚Äîthe bright red of
wine sparkling over gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the head of the table sat Count Brederode; his
doublet of scarlet velvet was covered with a network of
fine gold strung with pearls; every thread of his ruff was
gold, it came up to his ears and was scattered with brilliants;
from his shoulders hung a short mantle of silver cloth lined
with white fur; he leant his elbows on the table and
clasped between his jewelled hands a gold goblet carved
with grapes and vine leaves. As he emptied it, the page at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>his elbow refilled it; the wine splashed down his ruff, his
doublet, and his sleeves; he laughed long and merrily,
and now and then shouted at the top of his powerful voice‚Äî</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

</div>

<p class='c000'>Such was the scene that met the eyes of William and
his companions as they entered the Culemburg banqueting
hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince said nothing, but glanced to where Hoogstraaten
sat, half-vexed, half-amused, near his host, whom
he was endeavouring to restrain; Egmont uttered an exclamation
of annoyance and dismay; Hoorne frowned
bitterly, and darted a look of contempt from under his
heavy brows at the laughing Count Brederode.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the three great nobles, the most powerful
grandees in the Kingdom, were recognized, they were hailed
with shouts of welcome and surrounded by a crowd of
intoxicated youngsters, who took their presence as a good
augury for the newly named party.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, no," said the Prince, putting aside the beakers
that were being forced upon him. "I have come but for
the length of a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">miserere</span></i>‚Äîwe are here for the Seigneur
Hoogstraaten."</p>

<p class='c000'>That nobleman rose, glad of an excuse to retire, and
Brederode, turning, saw the three new-comers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, Highness!" he cried, staggering to his feet. "Will
you not come and drink the health of the beggars? Be
seated‚Äîhere on my right"‚Äîthen looking at Hoorne with
whom he had recently quarrelled, he added, "and the
Admiral also! I did not look to see your sober face at any
feast of mine, Count Hoorne!"</p>

<p class='c000'>At this taunt the Admiral, who had been glancing at the
saturnalia with genuine disgust and sincere vexation,
flushed to his bald head, and fixed his dark eyes menacingly
on the speaker.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>"I have come to save a better man than you, Count
Brederode," he answered, "from the consequences of
your folly. Folly? Is it not more than folly‚Äîis it not
near madness and treason?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The dark blue eyes of Brederode blazed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Think you your caution will save you, Count Hoorne?
I tell you Philip will spare you as little as he will spare any
man in this room, and Granvelle holds you as damned as any
heretic who ever ate a sausage on a Good Friday!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The sinister truth of these rude words made Egmont
blench, but the Admiral received them with gloomy
scorn; he felt quite secure in his own loyalty.</p>

<p class='c000'>William, assailed by cries of "Long live the beggars!"
the meaning of which was utterly unknown to him, made
his way through the revellers to where Brederode stood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sight of the well-known slender figure, the calm
earnest face, the air of authority, the immense attraction
and power that the Prince possessed, sobered the reckless
young nobles, the two dancing on the table were pulled
down, those seated were dragged to their feet, the uproarious
shouting was partly hushed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"By Heaven this goes too far, Count!" said William,
in a low voice. "The reckless things you have said to-night
you will forget to-morrow when you have slept off
your wine, but there are those who will not forget."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Spies!" muttered Brederode. "Spies!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Among these stupid seeming lackeys, maybe," replied
the Prince drily. "Why, man, you are not a fool; you
know the Escorial has spies everywhere."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I care not," said Brederode, with a certain grandeur
in his recklessness; "why should we cringe to Spain's
certain wrath? Nothing could bring us into favour at
Madrid; let us then defy monk and Spaniard and prove
we can defend our own!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Defiance of Spain given in this manner will be short-lived,"
answered the Prince. "Do you think you serve
the Netherlands this way? So you only gain laughter."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>"Let them laugh," returned the Count; "when the
time comes they shall see I can fight as well as I can
feast."</p>

<p class='c000'>And he was seizing his replenished bowl, with the toast,
"Damnation to the Inquisition and the Spaniards," forming
on his lips, when William sternly took the wine from
him and turned it on the floor, sending the beaker after
it on to the Persian rug.</p>

<p class='c000'>"End this, Brederode," he commanded, and his eyes
shone dark with anger. "This is not a pot-house‚Äîthere
are some high interests in our several keepings‚Äîfor the
sake of these reckless boys you have brought here to-night,
stop before you endanger all beyond help. Oh, Brederode,"
he added, with a sudden smile, "go to bed‚Äîfor you are very
drunk."</p>

<p class='c000'>Brederode stared at him, suddenly laughed, then sat
down silently, his glittering figure drooping back in the
wide-armed chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont and Hoogstraaten endeavoured to prevail on
the rest of the company to disperse; intoxicated and
excited as most of these were, they yet retained sufficient
wit to rouse to a sense of their own foolishness; to more
than one the red wine running over floor and table and
staining each others' faces and garments became a prediction
of the red blood that might be flowing soon.</p>

<p class='c000'>They well knew that Philip was as prodigal of blood as
Netherland nobles of their wine; the sobriety and slight
awe that had come over the gathering with the entry
and remonstrances of the three was heightened by one
of those trivial incidents that highly affect overwrought
minds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sugar foundation of the elaborate and costly sweetmeat
in the centre of the table suddenly gave way; the
heat had melted it unperceived, and as its support flowed
in sickly thick streams over the golden comport and the
stained cloth, the little figures of the confederates fell
here and there, mere crushed lumps of sweet, and nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>remained of the gorgeous piece of triumphal confectionery
but a sticky discoloured mess.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Men of sugar, men of sugar," muttered the Admiral.
"So shall this company melt away."</p>

<p class='c000'>The ugly omen was noticed by several; in twos and
threes they smoothed their disordered habits and departed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only Brederode remained where he was, wrapt in a sudden
melancholy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I shall die a poor soldier at the feet of Count Louis,"
he kept muttering; then: "Capon and sausage on Friday!
Who says I did eat it lies twenty feet down in his throat!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing the company was now dispersed, the three nobles
took their leave, Hoogstraaten accompanying them.</p>

<p class='c000'>They came out into the calm April night, which was
moonless and full of sweetness; the stars lay entangled
in little wisps of clouds, an under-breeze came fragrantly
from the spring fields of Brabant.</p>

<p class='c000'>William glanced back at the brilliantly lit mansion
behind them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is a silly short prologue to a long dull tragedy!"
he remarked.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Tragedy!" echoed Lamoral Egmont angrily. "You
speak always as if we were on disaster, Prince."</p>

<p class='c000'>William made no answer; they turned their horses'
heads towards the Brabant palace, where Margaret, frightened
and angry, debated matters of heaven and earth
with Vigilius and Barlaymont.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX<br /> MONTIGNY'S WIFE</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Count Hoogstraaten and the Baron Montigny
were playing tennis in the pleasant courts of the
Prince's palace gardens.</p>

<p class='c000'>May was now fully in bloom, and at midday the sun was
warm; the trees, newly covered with glossy leaves, cast a
pleasant shade over the smooth lawns.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the foot of one, a splendid beech, Montigny's wife
sat on silk cushions and rugs, and resting her chin in her
hand and her elbow on her knee, looked, with a certain
wistfulness, at the figure of her husband as he moved
lightly to and fro after the ball.</p>

<p class='c000'>Leaning against the tree was the Prince of Orange, and
close by, on a seat shaded by a high box hedge, sat Anne,
attended by R√©n√®e and the little German girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>Already utterly forgetful that she was there to entertain
the young bride, Anne was dozing in the sun, her head
falling forward in an ugly fashion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince took no notice of her, did not even glance
in her direction; he was talking earnestly with H√©l√®ne
d'Espinoy, the Baroness Montigny.</p>

<p class='c000'>This lady, though her marriage festivities had but just
concluded, and she seemed a creature made for joy and
carelessness, followed with an interest almost pathetic
the great and terrible events in which her husband
moved.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was talking now of the field-preachings and camp-meetings
which had spread with irresistible force all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>over the country‚Äîthe answer of the heretics to the
decrees of the Council of Trent.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is a wonderful thing, is it not, Prince," she said
in her soft voice, that seemed only fitted to sing to a lute,
"that people will do this for their faith? The penalty
is death alike to all; yet they go, men, women, and
children‚Äîrisking death and torture, to stand in the fields
to hear some unfrocked monk preach! Is it the Devil
makes them so strong?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You might rather call it God," said William, looking
down at her.</p>

<p class='c000'>She lifted her face now‚Äîa delicate, rather sad face,
with beautiful eyes. She fingered her ruff and eased it
where it pressed against her cheek, and sighed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You seem dismayed, Madame," said the Prince
gently.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," she answered at once. "Because my lord
goes to Spain."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He has resolved on that, then, finally?" asked
William quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes‚Äîhe and Marquis Berghen go this month." She
tried to smile. "Is it not hard? I have had him so
short a time."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He might refuse to go," answered the Prince, with
some eagerness.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is reluctant, but he has accepted," said the lady,
and again her glance turned towards the tennis court.
"But I," she added suddenly, "I dread that he should
go to Madrid!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You must not fancy disaster, Madame," returned
William.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am not foolish," she quickly defended herself.
"But I know he has offended the King by refusing to
enforce the Inquisition in his provinces‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, as to that, console yourself," said the Prince.
"Philip has a long arm‚Äîyour husband will be as safe
in Madrid as his brother is here, Madame."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>"You mean neither are safe?" she asked swiftly.
"But there is special danger in Spain‚Äîah, it is to walk
into the lion's mouth for a Netherlander to go to Madrid!
Count Egmont will not go again."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That will not save him if he has incurred Spanish
wrath," remarked William, with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Montigny's wife rose with an agitated movement.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What will happen?" she asked. "<em>He</em> will tell me
nothing‚ÄîYour Highness will be kinder, and tell me what
will happen?"</p>

<p class='c000'>She stood like a child before him, with her childish
request on her lips and her little hands clasped on her
white silk bodice.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I could tell!" smiled the Prince. "All is a confusion:
the Regent is bewildered; she has no power to
enforce her authority‚Äîthe King is silent."</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not add that he knew what was behind the
King's silence: that Philip was slowly and elaborately
preparing the most exact and far-reaching punishment
for those who had opposed his policy in the Netherlands,
and that the Duke of Alva, with an army at his back,
was soon to take the place of the overwhelmed and uneasy
Margaret.</p>

<p class='c000'>To change the lady's thoughts, he reverted again to the
field-preachings, to the courage of these men, who with
their swords at their side went out to hear a man with
a price on his head preach Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes they met in barns or houses, but more
often in the open fields, outside the city walls, where
preaching was forbidden.</p>

<p class='c000'>They went in hundreds, in thousands, so that sometimes
the city would be empty and the hymns of Clement
Marot would rise as fearlessly as if there was no Inquisition
waiting for them with faggot and chain, sword and
axe.</p>

<p class='c000'>William spoke warmly and with a lively sympathy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The mind and the soul are not in the keeping of king
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>nor priest‚Äîno man has a lordship over another man's
conscience," he said. "All history has proved that."</p>

<p class='c000'>H√©l√®ne d'Espinoy had never thought of this. She
was sorry for all these people who had to die, so sorry
she did not care to dwell on the thought, but questions
of ethics were unknown to her; she only wanted peace,
and her own happiness secure in a happy world.</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked at the garden, so fresh and lovely; at the
sky, so serene and soft; at the two young nobles laughing
over their game; at her own luxurious apparel‚Äîand she
wished, in a sad and simple way, that these things could
endure and that nothing would ever come to disturb
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, Seigneur," she said, "why cannot all men believe
in the one true God?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Each man's God is one and true to him, Madame.
The weaver of Tournay burnt to death over a slow fire
for casting the wafer out of the priest's hand found his
God as true as Philip finds his‚Äîfor to the last he called
on Him and even smiled. I wonder," added the Prince
thoughtfully, "if Philip in torment would find support
in his faith!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is all terrible," answered H√©l√®ne d'Espinoy in a
shaken voice, "and these people have power‚Äîthey will
fight, they will resist. It will not be so easy to subdue
them."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Easy enough for Alva," thought William. "The
Duchess is only helpless because she is without money
and without men."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Easy to subdue," he repeated aloud; and went on to
tell Madame Montigny of the camp-meetings at Tournay,
where the Reformers were six to one against the Catholics,
and when the Regent sent orders to the trained bands
to arrest the worshippers, it was found that all of them‚Äîthe
crossbowmen of St. Maurice, the archers of St.
Sebastian, the sword-players of St. Christopher‚Äîwere
themselves heretics, who eagerly attended the preaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>of Ambrose Wille, the famous disciple of John Calvin,
and new come from Geneva.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Since they are so much in earnest, these people,"
said Montigny's wife, "might not His Majesty allow
them their faith and their preaching?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"His Majesty will no more ever allow the preaching
than the people will ever give it up; and there is the
great tragedy‚Äîthese few poor people and the greatest
king in the world!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Montigny now left the tennis court and came towards
the two under the shadow of the beech tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>His face, which had the dark colouring, the look of
reserve and strength of his brother, Count Hoorne, but
none of that nobleman's joyless gravity, flushed with a
look of love as he glanced at his wife. It was to the Prince
he spoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Tennis is a childish sport for these open days of
spring‚Äîwe should be trying hound and falcons in the
open campaign."</p>

<p class='c000'>He put his arm lovingly round the Prince's shoulder
and drew him aside. Hoogstraaten, the intimate friend
of both, followed them.</p>

<p class='c000'>H√©l√®ne d'Espinoy glanced round for the Princess, and
R√©n√®e, with the watchfulness of one in charge of a puppet
whose strings must be pulled at a given signal, touched
her mistress on the shoulder and roused her attention.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the three young men were out of hearing
of the women, Montigny left talk of hounds and falcons
to speak at once of the state of things in his Stadtholdership
and of the immense increase of the daring and power
of the heretics. It was indeed a subject which no man,
from the humblest to the highest, could long keep from
his mind and lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>Montigny was inclined to think that the Netherlanders
had successfully asserted themselves; they had proved
that they were too numerous to be stopped by force
from exercising what religion they chose, and too courageous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>to be frightened by threats and punishment into
abandoning their faith, and persecution for the moment
had slackened. Brederode's party, "the beggars," were
strong and much to the front; their Petition or Request
was now before Philip. That monarch was silent‚Äîmight
he not be considering it reasonably?</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus Montigny, who shared the stubborn loyalty of his
brother Hoorne and the credulous optimism of Lamoral
Egmont.</p>

<p class='c000'>William saw the other side of the picture: he knew
that the famous Petition and the long deliberations which
had followed had only resulted in the "moderation"
decree, which the people instantly named "murderation,"
since the only concession it made was to sometimes
substitute hanging for a more horrible means of death;
and this was without Philip's sanction, and only flung
as a sop to the people by Margaret while she waited for
her brother's instructions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince saw too that the persecutions had only
slackened because the Regent found herself without
men or money, and that, whenever possible, the heretic
preachers were hunted down like wild beasts. Brederode
might rejoice, Montigny might be hopeful, but William of
Orange saw that the present lull was but the prelude
to a more awful vengeance on those who disobeyed Philip
than any that had yet befallen.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that the Regent's attitude of moderation, her
affected kindness to the nobles, her loud-voiced desire
for concord and peace, was but a farce, and that probably
in her secret letters she was denouncing all of them to
Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>These things William did not say to Montigny, he
had warned him so often; but he suddenly stopped in
the middle of the flower garden and said earnestly‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do not go to Spain‚Äîit is so useless."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You too?" cried Montigny. "All warn me‚Äîbut
how refuse? I have a conscience clear of disloyalty."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>"That will not help you in the Escorial," said William,
with some impatience.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have not offended His Majesty," persisted the
Stadtholder of Tournay and Tournaisis.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, Baron!" cried Hoogstraaten, "you offended all
Spain when you refused to burn the poor heretics!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I detest and spurn the Inquisition," answered Montigny
warmly. "I go to Madrid to protest against it‚Äîbut
never, Count, have I done anything to anger Church or King."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is known only to Philip and to Granvelle!" said
William, looking down at the bed of flowers at his feet.
"Do not go‚Äîit is so useless!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Count Egmont failed," urged Hoogstraaten.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I shall not be so easily caressed," returned Montigny.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The worse for you," answered the Prince. "Those
the Spanish cannot fool they will win another way. And
your going is for nothing. If Philip will pay no heed
to what the Regent writes, will he pay heed to what you
and Berghen say? Did he pay heed to you before?
Does he heed any argument?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am not hopeful," admitted Montigny, with a slight
sadness in his voice. "But I have been chosen, and I
cannot, without disloyalty, refuse."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince still stood looking down at the flowers which
were gently waving their soft heavy heads together.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do not go," he said for the third time. "Let another
man take this mission. You are young, you are just
wed‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Give me words of good omen!" cried Montigny,
with a laugh and a frown.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Good omen!" said William firmly. "I find no words
of good omen in my heart. Yet"‚Äîhe sought for the same
consolation which he had given H√©l√®ne d'Espinoy‚Äî"it
is true that Philip can reach one here as easily as in
Madrid‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>They turned now towards the house, to which the
women had already gone; and presently the Montignys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>took their leave, he being due at his last audience with
the Regent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoogstraaten lingered a little after him to question
the Prince anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is infatuate‚Äîdo you think he goes into great
danger?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think neither he nor Berghen will return," answered
William. "And I am sorry for that poor child, his wife‚Äîsorry
beyond words."</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned away quickly, then turned back again and
caught Count Hoogstraaten warmly by the hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<em>You</em> will not leave me, Antony?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am your poor servant always," replied the Count,
with great affection; "content to be guided by you, and
you alone, in all these troubles."</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he too left. William watched his little, gallant
figure ride away, and then returned to the antechamber
where he had parted from Montigny and his wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>There sat Anne in the same listless attitude in which he
had left her, with her elbows propped on a table covered
with a rich tapestry and her face sunk in her small, large-veined
hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>And behind her, as always, was R√©n√®e, motionless,
like her shadow.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was usual for the Prince to pass his wife in silence
when he thus met her by chance, but now, though with an
obvious effort, he came across the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Madame," he said; then, "Anne."</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked up; her sallow face flushed and she glanced
down again, spreading out her hands on her skirt.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e turned to go, but the Prince said, "Stay." He
stood looking at his wife in a silence that held no judgment;
he gazed at her rather as if he sought to throw the protection
of tenderness over her sickly unloveliness, her
miserable melancholy. Always in the Prince's attitude
towards his wife there had been this gentleness, which was
at once gallant and touching.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>"Anne, I have been wishing to speak to you."</p>

<p class='c000'>She made no response.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You always disliked Brussels, did you not, Madame?"
he added.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why do you ask that?" she demanded, with instant
suspicion.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Because I find it necessary that you should go to my
house at Breda," he answered kindly. "There is no need
for me to keep open this mansion‚Äîfew of us live in Brussels
now; and when I must come, I can lodge more simply. At
Breda you will be safer than here."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, this is your economy, your retrenchment!"
exclaimed Anne bitterly. "Do you not think I see how
miserable this establishment has become? Half the
servants we had formerly, and those with worn liveries;
the stables half empty, the gardens neglected, and nothing
increasing but debts!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The Princess exaggerated, but there was truth in what
she said‚Äîas R√©n√®e knew, and as it gave her a strange pang
to know.</p>

<p class='c000'>But William answered lightly‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am not as rich a man as I was, Anne, and shall be,
likely enough, poorer before the tale is told. But if I do
not spend what I did, it is not through niggardliness, but
because I may need money for other purposes than that
of magnificence. You shall be well enough at Breda."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not the Devil and all his legions shall drag me to
Breda!" answered Anne, with great violence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay, but your husband will," answered William,
smiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>His good-nature, that arose from neither weakness nor
indifference, but from a warm compassion and a deep
sympathy for others, never failed him; not once had
R√©n√®e seen him angry or rude to man or animal, and
towards women he was always softly gentle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne seemed to recognize this quality in him; to realize
that all her fret and fury might be expended in vain against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>his serenity. She rose and without another word or look
left him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince turned to R√©n√®e as she was following her
mistress.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are very faithful," he said, "and I know that you
have no easy service."</p>

<p class='c000'>In these words, in his voice and his face, she read the
bitterness of his sorrow and humiliation in his wife. She
noticed how tired he looked, how plain, even careless, was
his dress. He was already much changed from the splendid
cavalier who had mounted the stairs to greet his bride
that St. Bartholomew's Day in Leipsic.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is my one pleasure to serve," she answered; "there
is no other interest in my life."</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked curiously at her warm beauty, on which her
words seemed such a strange commentary.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I may be called to Antwerp, where there is great
trouble," he said; "in my absence speak to the Princess
anent Breda‚Äîfor there she must truly go, shortly."</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked away out of the window as if he had already
forgotten the waiting-woman, and R√©n√®e silently withdrew.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X<br /> ANTWERP</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Dupr√®s the skryer did not stay long in Brussels; in
a short time he had spent in lavish living the greater
part of the spoils he had gathered from the Nassau
mansion, and, his restless spirit tiring of the Brabant capital,
he began wandering through the troubled land, attaching
himself, where possible, to Brederode and his party of
"the beggars," who were making a noisy progress over the
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was at the great meeting the members of the Confederacy
held at St. Trond, and joined in the noisy demonstrations
and riotous feasting that "the beggars" always
indulged in and which made them but a poor reed for
Liberty to lean on. He went with Brederode and Culemburg
to Duffel, where they met Orange and Egmont, who
came on behalf of the Regent to urge the Confederates to
preserve the peace of the country instead of disturbing
it, as they did by their riots and armed assemblies.</p>

<p class='c000'>To which request Brederode replied very briefly that
they were there to protect the poor people who wished to
worship in the fields, and that until a satisfactory answer
to the Petition was brought back by the two envoys,
Berghen and Montigny, they would neither disarm nor
disperse.</p>

<p class='c000'>This answer was embodied in a paper which Louis of
Nassau and twelve other young nobles carried to Brussels
and put before the Regent herself.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Their boldness and plain speaking inflamed Margaret
to fury.</p>

<p class='c000'>She retorted by a cold and ambiguous rebuke; and
Louis, going further in his audacity, replied that the Confederacy
were not without friends, either at home or
abroad, and that if the Duchess still refused to convoke
the States-General, as she had been often implored to do,
and if, as many imagined, a Spanish invasion was preparing,
they, "the beggars," would know what to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after, the gathering at St. Trond broke up and
Brederode went to Antwerp, then perhaps the most
troublous spot in the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s accompanied the train of landlopers, gentlemen,
refugee Reformers, and ruined merchants who followed
Brederode, and made his living by selling charms, telling
fortunes, and reading the portents the fearful saw nightly
in the sky.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meghem and Aremberg, the two chief Cardinalists, were
already in the city, and when Brederode arrived the situation
became almost impossible. There were riots daily,
and a civil war, between Papists, Calvinists, Lutherans,
and Anabaptists, was considered as inevitable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brederode fanned the zeal of the Reformers into fury,
while Aremberg and Meghem supported the loyal, or
Spanish, party.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Senate, the Council, and the Corporation implored
the presence of the Prince of Orange, who was Burgrave
of the city; and being further urged by the Regent, he took
up the impossible task of pacification, and arrived in the
city in the midst of a tumultuous scene of welcome, Brederode
and his "beggars" meeting him beyond the walls with
deafening shouts and hurrahs.</p>

<p class='c000'>William had not placed himself on the side of the people,
and he was acting for the Government; but there was a
general confidence in him as the one man likely, or able,
to bring about concord and an understanding between the
King and his subjects.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>In Antwerp he at once devoted himself to the task of
restoring order, and spent laborious days and nights consulting
with the Senate, the Council of Ancients, and even
the trade guilds and the chambers of rhetoric, in inducing
Brederode to keep quiet, and in reasoning with Meghem
and Aremberg to suspend their bitterness against the
Reformers.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had succeeded in establishing some measure of
tranquillity, though no one was better aware than himself
that this tranquillity could not be long maintained, when
he received a summons from the Regent to attend a meeting
of the Knights of the Golden Fleece.</p>

<p class='c000'>He represented to Margaret the dangerous situation
within the city, and that probably tumults would follow
his departure; but she insisted on his presence in Brussels,
and he accordingly prepared to leave Antwerp.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a day or so all was quiet, but the 18th of August was
approaching, and that date was the feast of the "Ommegang,"
when the sacred image of the Virgin was taken
from her place in the Cathedral and carried in triumphant
procession through the streets; and the city senate, wards,
and guilds, as those responsible for the safety of the city,
as well as the Burgrave, looked forward with dread to
this event, which was sure to raise the passions of the
Reformers to the bitterest pitch.</p>

<p class='c000'>Others, such as many of the "beggars" and such-like
adventurers who remained in the city, looked forward
with pleasure to a riot, in which there would be a chance
to break a few heads and perhaps snatch a little plunder
in the fray.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among these was Dupr√®s. Nothing delighted him so
much as disorder and confusion; in troubled waters he
was always able to swim to the surface‚Äîin calm seas he
generally sank.</p>

<p class='c000'>And to this selfish and mischievous desire for riot and
storm was joined some sincere loathing of the Papists, and
some sincere sympathy with the persecuted Reformers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Dupr√®s was no theologian, and could not have argued
on either side of the religious question; but during his
stay in the Netherlands he had seen some executions, the
horrors of which made his hair rise and his blood run cold
to think of, and which had sent him for ever into the ranks
of Philip's enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the morning of the 18th, Dupr√®s was early in the
streets and had early taken up his position near the
Cathedral.</p>

<p class='c000'>The temper of the people was silent and dangerous;
but the sacred image was suffered to make her procession
in peace, assailed only by a few coarse jibes and a few cries
of "Long live the beggars"; and the day ended without a
tumult, to the great vexation of Dupr√®s. That evening
the Prince left Antwerp. The next morning it was discovered
that the image, instead of being stood, as was
usual, in the centre of the church, had been placed behind
iron railings in the choir.</p>

<p class='c000'>This soon brought together an excited and contemptuous
crowd, who passed in and out of the great church all day,
scoffing at the images and the altars.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards evening, a Papist sailor, who indignantly
protested against this irreverent behaviour, provoked
a scuffle in which blows were exchanged and swords
drawn.</p>

<p class='c000'>The priests and custodians of the church managed,
however, to clear the building of the rioters and to close
the Cathedral at the usual hour.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s, who had stationed himself in the porch all day
to exchange pleasantries with those of his acquaintances
who came and went, had to return home without having
seen the riots he had anticipated; but as he made his way
through the crowded street he met one of Brederode's
followers, a member of the Rhetoric Chamber of the
"Marigold," who told him that the Senate was in consultation
with the Margrave of Antwerp, that they were issuing
a notice calling on the citizens to preserve law and order,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>and that an express had been sent to Brussels to implore
the Prince of Orange to return.</p>

<p class='c000'>So it seemed as if those in authority feared worse than
the riot which Dupr√®s had been so disappointed in not
beholding. While he was eating his supper in one of the
small sailors' inns on the quay of the Scheldt, he heard
that the Senate was proposing to call to arms the city
companies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning, the second after the feast of the
Ommegang, Dupr√®s rose in the early midsummer's dawn
and proceeded to the Cathedral, which seemed to be the
centre about which all the deep passions of Antwerp
gathered.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he had protected himself in Brussels by wearing
Egmont's famous livery, so now he donned the popular
costume of the "beggars," a plain suit of grey camlet, a
mendicant's hat, a wallet and bowl at his waist, and one
of the "beggar" medals hung round his neck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early as it was when he reached the Cathedral square,
there were many already abroad‚Äîindeed, some had not been
to bed at all. Artisans, apprentices, tradesmen, clerks,
gentlemen, peasantry, women, girls, and boys stood about
in groups, talking earnestly.</p>

<p class='c000'>They all seemed emboldened by the fact that the Senate
had, after all, done nothing: no proclamation had been
issued, no companies called to arms, and the Cathedral
was open as usual.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s, wandering about the square from one knot of
people to the other, was suddenly moved to glance up
at the great church. He had often thought how seldom
men lift their eyes from the level of their fellows; whenever
he did so himself, he was conscious, as now, of a
certain shock.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sky was not yet wholly filled with the sun; the
dark purple hue of the August night still lingered in the
west, and the church was in shadow save for the exquisite
spire which soared up erect into the upper air and light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>and into the sunbeams now passing over the roofs of the
surrounding houses.</p>

<p class='c000'>The beautiful tower, rising so high above the city, as
delicate as a flower and as strong as iron, was a noble
object that symbolized the loftiest feeling of which, perhaps,
man is capable‚Äîthe spiritual desire to reach up to escape
the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s, always alive to the grand and the lovely, was
moved by the sight of the marvellous spire, so high above
all this passion, and turmoil, fury and bitterness which
beat and lashed below it; he felt a desire to enter the
building, though Romish churches were usually hateful
to him, and he considered them dangerous also for one
of his party.</p>

<p class='c000'>To-day, however, he was emboldened by the general
fearlessness of the crowd and by the number of Reformers,
or heretics, abroad.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he went up to the great bronze doors; before them
sat an old woman selling candles, tapers, and little trivial
pictures and images.</p>

<p class='c000'>To-day a little group was gathered round her, threatening
that her trade was nearly at an end, and hurling at her
pungent gibes to which she replied by fierce and voluble
abuse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s slipped by these, lifted the heavy curtain which
hung before the inner door, and stepped into the church.</p>

<p class='c000'>At first the immense size, the immense height, bewildered
him, he and the others there seemed like dwarfs lost in an
immense twilight forest.</p>

<p class='c000'>A forest strewn with jewels instead of flowers, and lit with
priceless lamps of gold and silver instead of by sun and
stars and moon.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was indeed the richest church in the Netherlands, and
one of the most sumptuous in Christendom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over four centuries of lavish labour, of infinite care, of
prodigal expenditure had gone to the adornment of the
building, the entire art expression of a nation had gone to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the decoration, all the finest inspirations of the best artists,
all the most painful and wonderful work of the best craftsmen
were contained within these lofty walls, and all was
sanctioned and hallowed by unending prayers and devotions,
unending tears and penitences, unending humiliations
before God.</p>

<p class='c000'>Like a closed box of precious jewels the magnificent
church, containing the utmost of man's efforts towards
beauty and splendour, lay humbly before the feet of the
Lord.</p>

<p class='c000'>The mystical aspect of this material splendour touched
and moved Dupr√®s; he stood inside the door, looking
down the vistas of the five aisles which were all enveloped
in a wine-coloured dusk, broken here and there by vivid
burning beams of light as the sun struck the fiery windows
where the glass blazed orange, purple, violet, and azure with
the uttermost strength of which colour is capable, and
which seemed to melt into infinite grey-green distance
behind the altar.</p>

<p class='c000'>In between the pillars of the naves were gorgeous tombs
on which ladies and cavaliers in alabaster, marble, brass,
and painted wood lay with humble hands pointing upwards,
while the glow from the windows fell on the silk and
brocaded banners which hung above them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The walls were lined with chapels and altars, each sparkling
like a cluster of brilliant gems; among them were
conspicuous those of the twenty-seven city guilds whose
banners and escutcheons were fastened above the entrance
grilles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vista was closed by a huge sculptured group of
white marble which rose above the High Altar; against the
soft mysterious shadows and flickering lights of the Lady
Chapel the colossal figures representing Christ and the
two thieves on the Cross showed with a luminous glow‚Äîhalf-rose,
half-amber‚Äîwhich rendered the outlines impalpable
and the hue like the soft substance of flesh.
Behind was dimly visible the exquisite outline of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>tabernacle or repository, the shrine for the mystical body
of Christ, which rose on a single pillar in a series of beautiful
arches and columns till lost in the deep warm shadows of the
roof.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s moved slowly down the centre aisle; the air was
heavy with the drowsy perfumes of myrrh and spikenard,
and misty with the perpetual fumes of incense; the eternal
lamps and the perfumed candles which burnt before
shrines and altars gleamed on wrought gold, embossed
silver, splendid paintings, silk tapestries, beaten bronze,
carved wood, and all the marvellous details of the crooked
stone of columns and roof and walls, which were rich with
a thousand forms of birds, beasts, flowers, and creations of
pure fantasy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s began to notice his fellow-companions who were
walking in twos and threes round the aisles; they were
mostly of the poorer sort, and their behaviour was rude and
noisy.</p>

<p class='c000'>A considerable crowd was gathered in the choir, where
the sacred image stared at them from behind her iron bars.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few priests hurried to and fro; they looked, Dupr√®s
thought, frightened.</p>

<p class='c000'>He wandered back to the main entrance and stared
out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun was now blazing hot and dry on the dusty
square, and Dupr√®s started to see what an enormous
number of people had collected. In the church porch a
fight had begun round the ancient pedlar, whose goods had
been flung on the ground, and who was defending herself
with sticks and stones.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pistol shots were fired, sticks brandished; blood began
to flow, and the temper of the people was fast rising with
fury.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s quickly withdrew into the church again, and
slipped into the first chapel inside the door which was empty,
and where he could observe unmolested.</p>

<p class='c000'>People began to throng into the cathedral; they surged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>to and fro, muttering together; the priests had all disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s was becoming stiff and tired, the marble step of
the chapel altar was hard; the air became stifling hot with
the increase of the sun without. But the skryer seldom
went unprovided against bodily needs; he drew from his
wallet a substantial meal of bread and meat and fruit, and
devoured it gravely, blinking up at the mosaic and paintings
that lined the chapel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The crowd was meanwhile increasing; their shouts and
cries, their threatening looks, promised no peaceful dispersal
this time.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s gently closed the gilt gates of the chapel on
himself, and grinned through them at the swarming
throngs.</p>

<p class='c000'>He wondered why the authorities made no effort to
check the tumult, and even as he was scorning them for
their cowardice, the great doors of the church were thrown
open, and a pale finely-dressed gentleman entered, attended
by the two burgomasters and all the senators in their robes
of office.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s knew this gentleman for Jan van Immerzeel,
Margrave of Antwerp, who had evidently come in person
to endeavour to quell the riot.</p>

<p class='c000'>Peering through the gilt bars Dupr√®s watched him as he
made his way, with dignity and calm, into the centre of the
church, watched his gestures as he entreated the people to
disperse.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If it was the Prince of Orange now!" smiled Dupr√®s,
"but who will stir for <em>him</em>?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The presence of the Margrave and the senators seemed,
however, to have some effect; many of the people left the
church, the others became more tranquil.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the day wore on; Dupr√®s, tired of the little chapel
but willing to see events to a finish, yawned and wearied
and presently fell asleep on the red damask cloth which
covered the altar steps. He was roused to the sound of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>the renewed tumult of a surging crowd refusing to leave,
declaring they would wait for vespers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Margrave, speaking from the High Altar, said there
would be no vespers that night; the people then pointed
out that the senators should quit first, leaving them to
follow, and the magistrates, weary with their long vigil,
departed, closing after them all the doors save one.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s now crept out of his hiding and stretched his
stiff limbs.</p>

<p class='c000'>He noticed the Margrave was still there, standing by the
High Altar‚Äîa small brilliant figure beneath the colossal
marble ones of Christ and the thieves.</p>

<p class='c000'>He held his cap with a heron's feather in his ungloved
hand and kept his eyes on the crowd. Though the magistrates
had some while since left the building, no one followed
them, but a considerable number began to stream in
steadily through the one door left open for egress.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Margrave, seeing this, sprang quickly on to the
altar steps and, raising his voice, commanded, and then
besought, the people to disperse.</p>

<p class='c000'>No sooner was his voice heard than a party of men, as if
in answer to a given signal, rushed on him and drove him
and his attendants towards the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was but a brief struggle; Dupr√®s saw the nobleman's
sword wrenched from his hand and sent whirling
and glittering into dusky air, then he was forced into the
street.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now with one accord the people ran to all the doors,
slipped back the bolts, and opened them; those waiting
without at once thronged into the church with the force
and swiftness of the sea across a broken dike.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s, driven before this resistless throng of humanity,
darted into the choir and clung to the back of the altar;
all Antwerp seemed within the church, and now there was
no one to restrain or threaten, to implore or coerce.</p>

<p class='c000'>The skryer shivered a little; through the open doors
of the Sacristy he had a glimpse of frightened priests and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>treasurers with gold and jewels in their hands; then they
cast down the precious objects and fled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s' blood warmed at the sight of the gold, his eyes
glittered.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Are they going to plunder the church?" he asked
himself, and he gazed round the unspeakable splendour
of the building with lustful eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>An ominous lull, a deadly silence reigned over the crowd,
then with sudden fierceness there rose the passionate
rhythm of a Protestant psalm breaking harshly on the air
that still seemed full of the chantings of the priests and
full of echoes of Latin prayers; the strong Flemish words,
rising from lusty Flemish throats, sprang forth like a battle-cry,
and with a movement that was also like the movement
of a battle, a number of men and women threw themselves
on the iron cage containing the image of the Virgin.</p>

<p class='c000'>In an incredibly few minutes the figure was dragged out,
torn into shreds, and cast into the air and along the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>A deep roar of triumph followed, and Dupr√®s, who could
scarcely believe his eyes, saw that they were beginning
to destroy everything in the cathedral.</p>

<p class='c000'>A shiver shook him, a sense of dread and terror, as if he
knew he was going to be a witness of something horrible;
he cowered down behind the lofty marble group of the
Crucifixion which rose so high above the heaving, surging
throng.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sound of blows began to mingle with the staves of
the psalms, and the shout of "Long live the beggars!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The crowd began to tear the tapestries from the walls,
to drag down the pictures and slash them with knives,
to knock over the images, and hurl the statues from the
niches.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s drew his breath sharply, his head began to reel at
the sight of this fury of desecration; then a lust, a madness,
an exaltation crept into his veins; he sprang out from
his hiding-place and drew the stout cudgel he kept at his
belt.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>For once the Reformers were in power, for once there
was no creature of Philip's to protect Philip's God‚Äîthe
Romish Church which had persecuted the heretics so unfalteringly,
so bitterly, so persistently, had now no champion
here to protect her temple.</p>

<p class='c000'>A woman whose red hair fell on a white neck and rough
kerchief leapt up the altar steps, dashed open the golden
doors of the sanctuary with her fists, dragged out the
Eucharist, and flung it down to be trampled under foot;
a number of youths sprang to her side, and in a moment the
altar was cleared of all the costly furniture.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great and extreme fury now seized the rioters; it
was as if they would revenge on the Papists' church all
the blood the Papists had shed, all the misery they had
caused; there were fifty thousand executions in the
Netherlands to be remembered against the Romish Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>The magistrates came down once more to the cathedral,
but on hearing the terrible, almost inhuman, noise that issued
from the building, they fled back to the town hall without
attempting an entrance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now so dark in the church, that the women
took the lamps and candles from the altars and lit the men at
their work; the beautiful column supporting the repository
was shattered under a hundred blows; as arch on arch,
pillar on pillar, crashed to the ground they were pounded
with mallets into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seventy chapels were utterly wrecked; there was not a
picture nor a tapestry left in place; with incredible speed
and incredible strength stone, marble, bronze, brass, wood
were hurled down, broken, hammered, defaced.</p>

<p class='c000'>The figures on the tombs were beaten out of all likeness
to humanity, the banners were torn down and slit to shreds,
knives and spears were driven into the mosaics and wall
painting, fragments of alabaster were hurled through the
gorgeous glass window. The inspiration, the labour, the
riches of four hundred years were in a few hours destroyed;
the incalculable wealth, the perfect flower of art which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>had come to perfection and could never be again, the
industry, the patience of entire lives, the offerings of generations,
the worshipped treasures of thousands‚Äîall these were,
in the space of a few hours, reduced to utter ruin, to broken
fragments, and tattered rags by those who saw nothing
in what they destroyed but the symbols of a monstrous
tyranny and the pageantry that disguised all cruelty and
wickedness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The madness got into Dupr√®s' blood; he struck right
and left, he shouted, he sang, he scaled up the pillars to
strike down the sculptures above them; he dashed into the
chapels to tear out the relics and leap on them; he split the
painted panels of altar-pieces, and dug out the inlay and
mosaic on the walls.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was one of the party who burst into the Sacristy,
who poured out the communion wine, and stamped on
the wafers, who rubbed their shoes with the holy oil and
hung the priests' priceless copes and chasubles on their
own shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they broke into the treasury; choice illuminated
missals and chorals, robes, staffs, and chalices were hurled
right and left, the elaborate cupboards and beautiful
chests being ruthlessly smashed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wealth of the church was immense, the hoarded
gatherings of centuries, and, it seemed to Dupr√®s in his
madness, as if he had at last found the Philosopher's
Stone: was not everything gold and precious stones?</p>

<p class='c000'>For as chest after chest was burst open and the contents
scattered on the floor, the rioters stood ankle-deep in
riches.</p>

<p class='c000'>Crystal goblets, candlesticks, pattens, lamps, chains, reliquaries
of fine gold; ewers, caskets, rings and staffs set with
pearl, with sapphire, with ruby and emerald; vases and dishes
of glowing enamel; statues and images in ivory and silver;
rosaries in rare gems; lace vestures worth as much as gold;
stoles, gloves, and staffs all of incomparable workmanship and
all sparkling with jewels; books with gold covers; censers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>of pierced gold, lamps of pure gold, candlesticks six foot
high of gold; altar cloths worked in gold thread, in silver
thread, in magnificent silk embroidery, in women's hair‚Äîall
these were cast out and defaced, torn and broken,
dashed against the walls, and spurned with the feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>But nothing was taken; stronger passions then cupidity
were governing men. The ragged Protestants, many of
whom had not the price of a supper in their pockets,
scorned to pilfer the priests' treasure; with one accord
they left the desecrated splendour and dashed back to
the church.</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s would willingly have enriched himself, but dare
not so much as take a single article.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the cathedral the last outrage was being offered to
the Romanist Faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>Round the High Altar, now bare and broken, stood a
circle of women holding aloft the flaring, smoking, perfumed
holy candles to light a group of men who, by means of
ropes and axes, were dragging the great marble Christ
from His position.</p>

<p class='c000'>St. John, the Maries, and St. Joseph had been already
hurled to the ground, where they lay shattered on the
marble pavement, and soon the colossal cross shivered
and swayed against the background of murky shadows,
fell forward within the ropes, and pitched on to the altar
steps.</p>

<p class='c000'>A dozen furious hammers soon dashed man and cross
to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was now nothing left standing in the church
but the two huge figures of the malefactors hanging on
their crosses.</p>

<p class='c000'>Awful and ghostly they looked with that blank space
between them, behind them darkness stained with the
red candlelight, around them ruin, and above them the
mysterious dark loftiness of the mighty roof.</p>

<p class='c000'>With bitter irony the heretics left the two thieves in
their places, then, having completely devastated and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>destroyed everything within the cathedral, they swept
out into the summer darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night was yet young, and there were thirty more
churches in Antwerp; triumphantly singing a hymn of
praise they dashed to the nearest, from which the trembling
priests had already fled.</p>

<p class='c000'>As Dupr√®s left the church, overcome by irresistible
temptation, he snatched up a gold vessel from the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before he could conceal the treasure a man near him
saw it and smote it out of his hand, at the same time
striking the skryer a blow that made him stagger.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No thieves in this company!" he shouted; "we are
not thieves but avengers!"</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XI<br /> THE PRINCE RESIGNS</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Ever since he had, on the fall of Cardinal Granvelle,
risen to prominence in the governing of the
Netherlands, William of Orange had endeavoured
to steer between party and party, to behave with moderation
and temperance, to extend one hand to the Catholics
and one to the Reformers and lead both to concord.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had never associated himself with the violent party
of 'Beggars' which Brederode had formed, and to which
Count Louis and Ste Aldegonde belonged; at the same
time he had resolutely refused to lend his civil authority
to enforce religious persecution, and had protested again
and again in Council, and in open letter, against the
establishment of the Inquisition and the overthrow of
the ancient laws of the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>This steadfast and just attitude had given him a power
during the troubles which followed the enforcement of
the Edicts of the Council of Trent which not one of his
colleagues possessed; the people had looked to him as a
possible champion, the Regent had thrust on him all the
most arduous tasks, and all had regarded him as the only
man able (if any man were able) to bring about a settlement
between Philip and his subjects.</p>

<p class='c000'>And in this high, arduous, and delicate position the
Prince laboured sincerely, wisely, and earnestly, without
thought of self-seeking, of disloyalty to the King, or to
the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>The Duchess, in her terror, her confusion, her powerlessness,
leant on his strength almost entirely.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had gone to Antwerp after the image-breaking,
and restored such order there that service was held in
the desecrated building the following Sunday; by his
presence he had brought about tranquillity in his own
provinces of Holland and Zeeland; he had drawn up
the Accord of 24th August by which the Duchess, terrified
almost into flight by the mania of image-breaking that
had swept over the country, granted permission for free
preaching on the part of the heretics, and it was he who
had seen that she kept her promises when she tried to
evade them; it was he who had influenced Brederode to
some quietness; he who had counselled all men on all
occasions to patience and moderation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In all these things he had acted more for Philip's
interests, in a manner more calculated to save Philip's
crown, than had any servant of the King, even Granvelle,
beloved of the Escorial.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he had acted with open eyes, without hope of
praise or reward, and knowing perfectly well that his
energetic and honest services would go for nothing, and
that, by refusing implicit obedience in the matter of the
Inquisition, he and the others who had acted with him
were for ever damned in the eyes of Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew too that the Regent only used him, that she
neither trusted nor confided in him; she went back on
his actions, tied his hands in a hundred ways, recalled one
day the concession she had permitted him to offer the day
before, made him the shield of her imperious weakness
and her vacillating terror.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that she even wrote to Philip denouncing him
as a traitor and at heart a heretic whose design in all
he did was self-aggrandizement; none the less in all crises
of trouble and confusion she summoned him and relied
on him.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the Prince had served her, for in so doing he believed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>he served the Netherlands; it was still his dream
to bring about some concord which would render the
coming of Alva needless.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now the fact was brought home to him that he
could no longer occupy an ambiguous position; before
him lay a letter from Margaret containing a copy of the
new oath for his signature, and her request that he take
this oath without delay.</p>

<p class='c000'>William half smiled as he contemplated the two sheets of
paper; it was such a childish, malicious, gratuitous trick
on Philip's part, and yet it served so well to test every
man in his service.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it put the astute Prince, who had walked so long
and so carefully between extremes, to the necessity of
having to choose one way or another.</p>

<p class='c000'>For this new oath which had arrived from Madrid instead
of the long-promised King himself, instead of the definite
news for which Margaret was so impatiently waiting,
consisted of a pledge that he, who was in the services of
His Majesty, was to hold himself bound to serve and obey
the Government in any place, against any person, without
exception or restriction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cardinalists had all taken this oath, and so, after
some hesitation, had Egmont.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now it lay before William in his room in his castle
at Breda, where his household now was, and to which
he had returned after a journey round the towns of his
provinces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Closed now was the gorgeous mansion in Brussels whose
hospitality and magnificence had been one of the wonders
of the capital; over were those days of luxury and gaiety,
feasting and thoughtlessness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince's household was now reduced to about a
hundred and fifty persons; he was more than ever in need
of money, and his debts increased.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he had recently refused a present of money from
the States of Holland as a thank-offering for his efforts in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>establishing peace in that province; he did not wish anything
he did to be laid open to the charge of personal
interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rising and going to the window, with that impulse that
always sends men to the light when in deep thought, he
stood looking out on the grey March sky, the grey walls
of the castle, and the bare trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the two papers‚Äîthe formula of the oath and the
Regent's letter‚Äîin his hand, he reviewed his position.</p>

<p class='c000'>One point in his circumstances was salient beyond all
others‚Äîhis utter isolation.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had last seen the two nobles, Egmont and Hoorne‚Äîwho
were his rivals in greatness and prestige, and had
been united to him by so warm a friendship‚Äîat Diendermonde,
when he, exasperated by the Regent's falseness
and particularly by her action in sending Eric of Brunswick
with troops to the towns that were within the Lordship of
Orange, had urged Egmont to take a definite stand against
the Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Stadtholder of Flanders had refused; he was
finally and definitely pledged to Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Hoorne, though he had acted justly towards the
Reformers in Tournay‚Äîwhere he had been in authority
during his brother's absence‚Äîand though he was embittered
by the ruined condition of his fortunes and Philip's neglect,
still remained sullenly loyal to Spain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Montigny wrote from Madrid an account of Philip's
wrath at the image-breaking, the Accord, and the public
speaking, and expressed his own surprise and disgust at
these outrages on the ancient faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis of Nassau and Ste Aldegonde were now outside
the scope of the Prince's influence and entirely at one
with Brederode, who was enclosed in his hereditary town
of Vianen which he appeared to be fortifying, and with
his party were most of the younger nobles, Culemburg,
Van der Berg, De Hammes, and their fellows.</p>

<p class='c000'>William of Orange stood quite alone.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>And he had come to a juncture when he must either go
into open opposition to the King or pledge himself to be his
unquestioning instrument.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was largely as one feeling his way in the dark with
regard to the policy of Margaret and Philip, but he guessed
the faces of the cards so carefully concealed; if he stooped
to take the oath it would not be likely to save him when
the time came for Philip to strike.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince hated Philip well, but he was able to judge
him with an especial clearness; he was convinced in his
heart that the King had already judged and condemned
all these Netherlanders who had in any way opposed him.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Diendermonde meeting he had shown to Egmont
and Hoorne an intercepted letter from D'Alava, Spanish
envoy in Paris, to the Regent.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this document was very plainly set forth the King's
intention towards the three grandees, who were to be
arrested the moment a Spanish army reached the Netherlands,
and the writer further stated that the two envoys
in Madrid "are met with smiling faces, but will be never
permitted to leave Spain alive."</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont put this letter before the Regent, who declared
it to be an impudent forgery; with this statement Egmont
was satisfied.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Prince of Orange was not; even were the letter
false he believed that it contained the true sentiments of
the Government.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no one to share his views, to understand his
attitude; he felt that very keenly now, when he stood at
the parting of the ways.</p>

<p class='c000'>Brederode and Louis thought him hesitating and cold,
the Count party thought him disloyal, the people no
longer trusted him; his German relatives were lukewarm
in their attachment, his wife never saw him but she railed
and scolded at the way he had allowed himself to be
ruined for a parcel of heretics, and deafened him with
complaints of the life at Breda castle.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>The only man standing by him at that moment was
Anthony Lalaing, Count Hoogstraaten, the gallant young
noble who had been his right hand in the troublous Antwerp
days.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Hoogstraaten was at the Prince's feet, waiting to be
instructed; he was nothing on which to lean.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again William looked at the two papers which the March
wind fluttered in his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he declared against Philip, what could he do?</p>

<p class='c000'>What possible chance had the Reformers against Spain?</p>

<p class='c000'>Valenciennes, which had dared to rebel, had been reduced
to misery and desolation; Noircames had put to
death some thousands of the inhabitants; a garrison had
been sent to Tournay; Egmont was forcing troops on all
the towns of Artois and Flanders; the famous confederacy
of the beggars was broken; Brederode was making a
burlesque of resistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>De Hammes was breaking images and feeding his parrot
with holy wafers‚Äîa rope of sand, indeed, there!</p>

<p class='c000'>And would the German Princes move in the cause of their
fellow Protestants?</p>

<p class='c000'>This was doubtful, as they were bitterly divided
among themselves‚Äîsome being Lutherans, some Calvinists.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the Emperor, though inclined to acknowledge the
Reformation, was bitter against the Calvinists, and this
sect was in the majority among the Reformers of the
Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was it likely that he would embroil himself with
Spain for the sake of the oppressed provinces.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was the Huguenot party in France, but they had
their own battles to fight, their own ground to maintain;
there was a Protestant Queen in England, but she was
cautious, and ardent for peace, and not likely to go to war
for the sake of religion.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed to William that Philip had the Netherlands
under his heel to crush as he pleased.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>The Prince turned back to his writing-table and took up
his pen.</p>

<p class='c000'>For himself, what was this step going to cost?</p>

<p class='c000'>Gradually the old magnificent life had changed, the
splendid young noble had become the grave man of affairs.
Still not much over thirty, and endowed with a warm and
joyous temperament, used to wealth and power, pleasure
and luxury, he found himself about to take up a position in
which all these things must be foregone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Looking back over the brief years since his second
marriage, he saw how slow, how subtle had been this change
in himself and in his surroundings; looking ahead, he saw
that the coming change would be marked and swift‚Äîand
terrible.</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled as he retailed the jousts, the tourneys, the
feasts, the hunts, the dances‚Äîthose days were over.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been a silent, secret struggle between him and
Philip ever since that monarch had left the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now it would be secret and silent no longer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince flung down his gage to the King.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mending his quill and drawing a sheet of paper towards
him, he wrote to Madame Parma returning the oath, and
resigning all his offices.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>"As His Majesty now writes that all officers and servants,
with no exception, must subscribe to this oath, or be discharged
from his service, I must consider myself of the
latter number, and will retire for a time until His Majesty
comes to these provinces himself to obtain a true judgment
of affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Therefore, I pray Your Highness, send some gentleman
to me with proper papers of dismissal, to whom I may
deliver my commission, assuring you at the same time that
I will never fail in my service to this country for the good
of this land."</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>So with words that were gentle and courteous, as
habitual with him, he phrased his resolution.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>"No longer Philip's servant, no longer his servant," he
said to himself as he sealed the letter; "and now, what
next?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Himself, he did not know. His resignation of his offices
left him almost a ruined man, but it left him free.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sighed like a man from whose shoulders a burden has
been lifted, locked away his letter, rose and went down to
the castle grounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>He could see the little town clustered round the great
church; the winding river with low horse-burdened bridge,
all grey in the grey air and lashed by the March wind.</p>

<p class='c000'>He leant against one of the ramparts which rose up,
forming a wall to the garden, and his keen grave eyes rested
on the church.</p>

<p class='c000'>Free of Philip's service‚Äîwhat of Philip's faith? The
House of Nassau was Protestant; he had assumed the
Romish Faith to please the Emperor, but he had been
born and educated in the Reformed Faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he looked down at the church he thought of that.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never had he considered religion much; it had been
merely part of the ceremony of his life, the custom of every
gentleman. Now he began to consider, not religion, but
God.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it seemed to him God was not guiding Philip's
councils, nor inspiring the persecutions of the Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Might He not rather be favourable towards these poor
people who were paying with their lives for their desire to
worship Him as they wished?</p>

<p class='c000'>William's mind was tolerant and liberal, it had never
been confined in the elaborate ceremonies of the Romish
Church, nor could it ever subscribe wholly to the fanaticism
of the extreme Protestants, like Ste Aldegonde; but of late
he had sickened against the show and pretension, the
cruelty and bigotry, the avarice and falseness shown by the
professors of the ancient faith, and had turned naturally to
the sterner, simpler creed that was struggling so hard for
existence.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>The Prince could not believe that God or Truth were
wholly on one side or the other, but his sympathy and
taste turned, every day more certainly, towards the oppressed,
the miserable, the helpless Reformers.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had not stood long looking over Breda before he was
joined by Hoogstraaten, now his guest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two young men did not speak; they stood side by
side looking over the grey town and the grey church.</p>

<p class='c000'>The keen wind lifted the little locks on the Prince's
temples and showed the faint streaks of white that now
mingled with the dark chestnut.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near by, in the still bare garden, R√©n√®e le Meung was
searching for the first faint sprays of green; with a sad little
bouquet of these trembling promises of spring in her hand,
she stood silent, with tears in her eyes, looking at the Prince,
who did not notice her at all, but continued to gaze at the
great church of Breda.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XII<br /> ORANGE AND EGMONT</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>The Regent, more and more in a dilemma, refused
to accept the Prince's resignation; indeed, shortly
after he had offered it she implored him to again go
to Antwerp, where Calvinists and Lutherans were embroiling
the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>William went, arriving after the disastrous engagement
of Ostrawell, when a band of fiery Calvinists under Ste
Aldegonde's brother, Jean de Marnix, had been utterly
cut to pieces, their gallant young leader being the first
to fall.</p>

<p class='c000'>William had come in time to prevent an internecine
war that would have devastated the city; at great peril
to himself he had prevented the two Protestant sects from
flying at each other's throats, and actually restored order
in Antwerp and induced the crowd to say after him,
"Vive le roi!"</p>

<p class='c000'>But he knew that all he did was useless; when the
English Envoy congratulated him on his splendid labours,
he replied: "But it will not please the King; I know there
is nothing of this that will please the King."</p>

<p class='c000'>It did not even please the Regent; too many concessions
had been made to the heretics, too much gentleness shown.
She preferred the way Egmont had treated Valenciennes,
which had been reduced to a complete and bloody silence;
and the method of Noircames, of Meghem, of Aremberg,
who, rejoicing at the approach of a profitable civil war,
were desolating the country, crushing the heretic with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>an iron hand, and sweeping his property into their own
pockets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet Margaret still refused to accept the resignation that
William tendered again and again; she still clung to his
strength and authority, even while she denounced him in
every letter she wrote to Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps, too, she guessed that Philip had his vengeance
ready for the Prince of Orange, and that he would be wroth
with her if the illustrious victim was suffered to escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>For Margaret was sincere in nothing but her desire to
serve her brother, and true to nothing save to that brother
and the Romish Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>She tried all her arts to induce the Prince to remain in
the King's service: she sent him a flattering letter, appealing
to "his noble heart, his illustrious and loyal descent,
his duty to King and country"; she invited him to Brussels,
to a meeting of the Knights of the Golden Fleece; and when
he declined both, she sent Berty, secretary of the State
Council, to the Prince at Antwerp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Berty's feeble and formal rhetoric had no effect whatever
on the Prince, unless it caused him to glimpse more
clearly than ever the trap that was being so carefully set.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that Philip was not coming to the Netherlands,
but that Alva was within a few days of starting for Brussels
with the finest army in Europe at his back.</p>

<p class='c000'>And while he listened to the specious Berty prating of
loyalty and the King's goodness, he had in his pocket a
letter from that sturdy old Landgrave Philip who had
opposed his marriage with Anne, but who had since become
his friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Landgrave had been lured into a long captivity
by the arts of Granvelle and Alva, as he now reminded
William.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let them not smear your mouths with honey," he
wrote. "If the three seigneurs, of whom the Duchess
Margaret has so much to say, are invited to Court by Alva
under pretext of friendly consultation, let them be wary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>and think twice ere they accept. I know the Duke of
Alva and the Spaniards, and how they dealt with me."</p>

<p class='c000'>The only concession Berty could obtain from the Prince
was his consent to once more meet Egmont, Mansfeld, and
Aerschot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The interview was arranged to take place at a village
outside Antwerp, named Willebroek; and William, with
but a couple of grooms, rode out there one morning in early
April.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a pleasure to him to ride across the fresh country,
to feel the soft turf beneath his horse's feet, to see the mild
blue sky overhead, and about him all the new greenery‚Äîon
briar, hedge, and tree, where the birds fluttered among the
leaves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lovely morning air on his face reminded him of
grand days at the chase; it was long now since he had
ridden out with hawk and hounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>This part of the country was as yet unscathed by famine
or bands of mercenaries; the grain was sprouting in the
fields, the brown and white cows wandered in the pastures,
the little farms were undisturbed amid the groves of
budding poplar and willow trees, the peasants went to
and fro about their work as if they had never heard of
Ostrawell and Valenciennes and the coming of Alva.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little village of Willebroek lay peaceful beneath
the early sun; the white houses with green shutters,
painted fronts, and tiled roofs, the limes in the market-place
just clouded with green, the church with the lead
spire, the canal with the arched wooden bridge, up which
the flat barges were slowly making way against the stream,
all combined to make an image of plenty, ease, and prosperity.</p>

<p class='c000'>William drew rein before the inn, where he was to meet
the other seigneurs. He felt light-hearted; he looked up
into the blue air; he smiled at a group of children who
were going by with their hands full of the pearly blossoms
of hawthorn.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>The inn was an old building with a red tiled roof, rising,
step by step, into a point under which was an alcove
where a white figure of the Madonna stood against a blue
and gold glory.</p>

<p class='c000'>The green shutters were all laid back to disclose the
clean shining windows; the door stood open, showing a
long dark brick passage, and through another open door
at the end a glimpse of a sunny garden with pigeons.</p>

<p class='c000'>This garden spread either side the house and was filled
with young fruit trees, the dark pink bloom of the peach
mingling with the warm white of plum and pear.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the windows of the inn stood glazed pots of a shining
green and yellow, filled with gilliflowers and striped pink;
a girl in a blue dress was hanging out linen on a box hedge
beyond the fruit trees.</p>

<p class='c000'>William noticed all these things with a great keenness;
everything he saw, everything he did or said now was
memorable, for all belonged to a portion of his life that
would so soon be over.</p>

<p class='c000'>He entered the modest house, and the awed innkeeper
showed him into the parlour.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a low, spacious, cool room, full of the fragrance
and sounds of the garden and shaded by a little beech
tree, the fresh clear green leaves of which swept the leaded
panes of the window.</p>

<p class='c000'>The floor was smooth brick, the walls dark and polished,
the ceiling beamed; on shelves and on the large bureau
stood silver tankards, coloured pottery, and painted
glasses shaped like bells and flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the empty fireplace the brass andirons gleamed
golden, in the centre of the large round wooden table
stood four brass candlesticks, a snuffer and tray.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this table sat Lamoral Egmont, his head resting on
his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nobility of his figure, the extreme richness of his
dress, the gallant handsomeness of his face, ill accorded
with the clean, neat, and humble room.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>He wore violet and silver and a mantle of a tawny
orange colour that fell over the brick floor; his charming
head was framed by a ruff of silver gauze; his weapons
were many and elaborate; by him on the table lay his
hat, a pistol, his gloves and whip.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the other side of the table sat Count Mansfeld, an
elderly man of no particular presence, handsomely attired
in black and gold; while within the window embrasure
was the insignificant figure of Secretary Berty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince gently closed the door and stood smiling
at all three.</p>

<p class='c000'>His slight figure, plainly habited in a brown riding suit,
soft high boots, and a falling ruff; his small head, held
erect without pride, and valiantly without arrogance;
his dark face, with the regular features and laughing eyes‚Äîthe
whole man, so composed, so pleasant, so unfathomable,
seemed to strangely impress the three who waited
for him‚Äîto impress them almost with uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lamoral Egmont rose, filling the room with his magnificence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We meet strangely, Prince," he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>William greeted all with even courtesy, then took his
seat at the round table, placing his hands, half concealed
by the linen ruffles, before him on the smooth surface
as he had placed them in the council chamber at Brussels
when the letters from Philip had been read enforcing the
decrees of the Council of Trent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mansfeld had never been close in his friendship, and
always a warm upholder of the Government; Berty was
little other than Margaret's spy; it was to Egmont the
Prince addressed himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have come to persuade me," he said gently.
"Speak, Count, speak."</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont flushed; despite his loyalty and his now firm
attachment to Spanish rule, he always felt uneasy in the
presence of the man who had once so influenced him and
who now was divided from him by an ever-widening gulf.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>He repeated the arguments of Berty, endeavouring to
enforce them by the weight of his own belief and his own
friendship for the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke verbosely, emphasizing his meaning with many
illustrations and continually praising the King.</p>

<p class='c000'>A bee buzzed in the window-pane the while, evading
Berty's furtive fingers; it made as much impression on
the Prince as did the words of Lamoral Egmont.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he listened civilly, keeping his dark eyes steadily
on the speaker's face; but when at last Egmont had
finished, he threw back his head with a little laugh and
spoke a few words that tossed all the Count's formal
phrases back at him as useless.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, Egmont!" he cried. "I did not ride from
Antwerp to be persuaded, but to persuade. What you
have said can never move me. Would that what I say
could move you!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont made no reply; he glanced at Berty, and
slightly shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Mansfeld spoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then what are the intentions of Your Highness?"
he asked, with some haughtiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My intentions are well known," answered the Prince
simply. "I have resigned all my offices. And I shall
leave the Netherlands."</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont started.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Leave the Netherlands!" he cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you think," answered William, "that I will resign,
make myself a rebel, and then wait the coming of the
Duke of Alva?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Take the oaths," said Mansfeld, "and withdraw your
resignations. We and the Regent alike entreat you to this."</p>

<p class='c000'>William moved back in his chair and turned his head
so as to face Mansfeld.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Once and for ever, Count," he said, and from behind
his pleasant calm there flashed the strength of an immovable
purpose, "I declare I will not take an oath which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>is against my honour, an oath that makes me a tool, an
executioner. Is William of Orange"‚Äîhis voice was
suddenly angry‚Äî"to await the orders of the Duke of
Alva? To be the servant of the Inquisition?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Egmont flushed, thinking of Valenciennes and the
many poor Christians he had slain there, and of the old
days when he and Orange had been one in protesting
against the Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You mock at loyalty," he said gloomily, "but you
go to your ruin. If you leave the Netherlands, your
property will be confiscated."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I stay, I shall lose more than my estates," replied
William. "I will sooner encounter all that may happen
from this my action than sacrifice my conscience by the
taking of this oath. No more of it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then we talk in vain," said Mansfeld sternly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"On that subject, yes," answered the Prince. "But
I would further speak to Count Egmont." He looked at
his friend earnestly, and spoke with a certain passion.
"Oh, Lamoral Egmont, give your loyalty to your native
land and not to Spain. Come with me; I will follow you.
I will be your faithful soldier‚Äîrisk everything in a good
cause rather than in a bad one. I was grieved the victor
of St. Quentin and Gravelines should come to the
massacring of poor artisans; but that may be redeemed.
Strike for freedom, Count, not for tyranny."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You speak treason," cried Egmont, with some heat.
"I am loyal, and will keep that loyalty unstained."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It shall not avail you," returned William, in a moved
tone. "Do you think Philip has forgotten or Philip
forgiven? Do you think Alva comes to caress you,
bringing in his hands riches and honours? I tell you
he comes to strike down all those who have offended
Spain, and you are one of them."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have no fear," answered the Stadtholder of Flanders
stoutly. "I do not dread to see the country in the hands
of the Spaniards, nor to welcome the Duke of Alva."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>"No one need fear who has a clear conscience," added
Mansfeld.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Seigneur," said the Prince impatiently, "you speak
like a child. You are safe because you were one of
Granvelle's partisans‚ÄîEgmont was the Cardinal's enemy;
Egmont has done many things well noted in Madrid. I
tell you he is doomed‚Äîif he stays he is doomed as surely
as any poor peasant who has looked impudently at an
image."</p>

<p class='c000'>"These are the words of a rebel!" exclaimed Mansfeld.</p>

<p class='c000'>"For the true service of the King I am always ready,"
returned William, "but to Alva, Granvelle, and the
Inquisition call me rebel if you will‚Äîfor I do protest
against them and their authority and all attempts to
force the faith of these people, which attempts are in
defiance of laws and privileges and wholly against God."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay," said Egmont, "it is His cause, as any priest
will tell you."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I spoke of God, not of priests," answered the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is bold saying," remarked Mansfeld. "Has the
insolent blasphemy of Calvin or Luther found so high
a convert? Has the raving, vulgar fury of the field-preacher
shaken the faith of the Prince of Orange?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Mansfeld spoke with bitter irony and his face coloured
with indignation.</p>

<p class='c000'>William smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, I am studying theology!" he said. "I may find
comfort from Geneva as easily as from Rome when I have
finished my learning."</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked straightly at Mansfeld.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I was bred a heretic," he added.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mansfeld rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Enough," he said. "I see this conference is useless."</p>

<p class='c000'>William rose also; he went to Egmont and laid his
hands affectionately on the Count's shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not take this action thoughtlessly nor suddenly,"
he said, "but after deep reflection and long weighing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>events; I know I lower my fortunes and jeopardize my
estates‚Äîyet I do the wiser thing. I beseech you by our
ancient friendship, by our common charge, for the sake of
those dear to you, to follow my example. I entreat you
not to wait the coming of Alva."</p>

<p class='c000'>But Lamoral Egmont was not to be moved. His lodestar
was Spain; and now he had Mansfeld watching him
and Berty noting down every word he said, his reply
was curt, almost wrathful.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have an easy conscience; and if I have committed
some faults I rely on the clemency of the King‚ÄîI lean on
His Majesty."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Alas!" said William, "you lean on what will
destroy you. You boast yourself secure in the King's
clemency, and so lull yourself with a security which does
not exist. Would that I might be deceived, but I foresee
only too clearly that you are to be the bridge which the
Spaniards will destroy as soon as they have passed over it
to invade our country."</p>

<p class='c000'>With that he ended, somewhat abruptly, as if he indeed
saw that it was useless to try and open Egmont's eyes
to his danger, and turning away picked up his mantle
and hat as if to end a hopeless argument.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You will be the ruined man, not I," remarked Egmont
in some agitation; "it is you who throw everything away
for a shadow!"</p>

<p class='c000'>William moved towards the door.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Will you not dine with us?" asked Mansfeld formally.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay," replied the Prince. "I am pressed to return
to Antwerp."</p>

<p class='c000'>With Egmont he would have gladly stayed, but he had
no mind to eat and drink with Mansfeld and Berty.</p>

<p class='c000'>He took his farewells. Egmont looked at him a little
wistfully; mutual affection had gone deep into the hearts
of each.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Count had moved to the door, and as William passed
he advanced a step.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>The Prince turned and suddenly embraced him, clasping
him for a second to his heart; then with tears in his eyes
he left the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were tears too on Egmont's cheek.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He looked at me as if he thought never to see me
again!" he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A landless, exiled, powerless man," remarked Mansfeld.
"How low is the great Prince of Orange fallen!"</p>

<p class='c000'>A little maid entered the room to prepare the dinner;
she looked with wonder and reverence at the three gentlemen,
who had none of them revealed their identity.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, seigneurs!" she said, "who is the young cavalier
who has just ridden away? He never saluted the Virgin
above the door, and in these days‚Äî‚Äî!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Mansfeld glanced at Egmont.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You may call him, my child, many names, for he had
many honours; now you had best call him‚Äîthe Heretic,"
he said dryly.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> THE COMING OF ALVA</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>R√©n√®e le Meung moved about the fine apartments
of the Princess in Breda Castle, sorting clothes,
arranging bags and boxes, and packing the long
coffers that were to be carried into the courtyard and there
loaded on the baggage mules.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alva was coming; he had already sailed from Carthagena.</p>

<p class='c000'>And William of Orange and his household were leaving
the Netherlands for Germany, there to take up residence
with his mother and Count John in the castle of Dillenburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>As R√©n√®e moved about her task, she vividly recalled
how she had left Germany, that hot, weary day of the feast
in Leipsic, when she had moved about among Anne's
things as she was moving now, folding away the bridal
dresses, locking away the bridal trinkets with the sound
of the joy bells in her ears and the flare of the joy fires
reflected in the window-panes.</p>

<p class='c000'>She recalled how she had crept into the gallery overlooking
the great hall and had seen the Prince and Princess
seated side by side on the gold couch, receiving the homage
of the maskers, and all her own fatigue and distaste, the
close perfumed air of the Town Hall, and the rich scents of
the feast.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had been reluctant to leave Germany, which had
been a peaceful refuge, and to return to her own country,
which for her was dark with horrible memories; and now
she was not sorry that this Brussels life had ended‚Äîa
life of magnificence, which she had only glimpsed from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>behind the windows of Anne's apartments; a life of great
affairs and tremendous events, which she had only heard of
from the mouths of pages and servants; a life of continued
service, of self-denial, of submission to caprice and tyranny.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now it was over, and she would go to Dillenburg, where
every one was Protestant, and be near the Prince's mother
and sisters, who perhaps would be kind to her and notice
what she was doing for Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her starved heart was greedy for kindness and praise.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was glad, too, that Anne was leaving the Netherlands
without having again seen Jan Rubens or Dupr√®s; she felt
the Princess would be safe in Dillenburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet R√©n√®e was sad; she could not be happy leaving
behind her a country so broken, so oppressed, so desolate.</p>

<p class='c000'>She heard men mention Alva with awe and terror; she
saw that the Prince was departing before he came; and she
feared even worse things for the Netherlands than their
present great calamities.</p>

<p class='c000'>But her piety had strengthened; her body, denied and
rendered subject to her soul, grew weaker, and the soul
within became stronger, and so nearer God.</p>

<p class='c000'>She trusted in Him not to forsake His people, and she
believed in William of Orange as His Captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gorgeous young Papist cavalier whom she had looked
on for the first time at Leipsic on his wedding day, whom
she had thought frivolous and worldly, was now become
the man on whom centred all her hopes for her country and
her faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>Other and reckless men had taken up the people's cause
and won the people's heart‚Äîmen like Brederode, Count
Louis, Ste Aldegonde, and De Hammes; but though these
were the names shouted in the market-place, R√©n√®e had
given no heed to them at all.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was to the Prince, who was, nominally at least, still a
Papist, who had acted until the very last in fulfilment of
his duty to the King, who had checked the fervour of the
Reformers and was even hated by the Calvinists for his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>behaviour after the engagement at Ostrawell‚Äîit was to him
that R√©n√®e confidently looked to save the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>And that confidence, strengthened by her woman's
devotion to a person beloved, supported her in this second
flight from her native country.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was so lost in thought as she went about her task
that it was with a little start that she became aware of the
presence of another in the chamber.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne was standing in the door of the inner room.</p>

<p class='c000'>She leant against the wooden lintel and stared at R√©n√®e.
The white linen round her head and shoulders made her
face look yellow and faded as that of an old woman; her
blue dress clung to her meagre figure in straight lines;
there was no attempt now to hide her deformity of raised
shoulder and crooked hip; her hands pulled nervously at
her girdle.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your labour is for nothing," she said. "I am not
going to Dillenburg."</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e went on packing.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness will certainly go," she answered quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No," said Anne violently. "I was a fool to leave
Brussels‚Äîbut I will not leave the Netherlands. Why should
I go into exile? Where is all my state? It has melted
like snow. There is no one to look after me; I can hardly
get a drink of beer or wine when I want it. He never gives
me any money‚Äîhas he thrown it all away on this miserable
beggar war? I will not be the wife of a ruined man‚Äîam I
to live on wind and eat my hands and feet? By God, I
had better have married a simple German Count than this
great Prince."</p>

<p class='c000'>The resignation of the Prince and the subsequent alteration
in his fortunes might certainly have frightened many
women; but R√©n√®e had no spark of sympathy for Anne's
complainings and railings.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness came to Breda, and Your Highness will
go to Dillenburg."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne gave her a look of hate.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>"I would sooner stay and put myself at the mercy of
Alva," answered the Princess sullenly. "I do not fear
the Spaniards."</p>

<p class='c000'>"His Highness has decided to leave the Netherlands,"
said R√©n√®e, with an air of finality.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne limped towards her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You hate me, don't you?" she asked, with some
eagerness. "You said you hated me, once."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I would have loved you, Madame, but you would not
permit it‚Äîand‚Äîand some of your actions I needs must
hate."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, set yourself free of me," urged the Princess.
"Help me to escape‚ÄîI have friends in Cologne‚ÄîI want
to go to Cologne."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dupr√®s and Rubens are there," was the thought that
instantly stabbed R√©n√®e; she turned white and could not
speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There are some gentlewomen there I know," continued
Anne. "I want to go there‚Äîhelp me escape. I will give
you anything you wish for‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, Highness, Highness," cried R√©n√®e, "you speak
like a child. It is impossible for you to go to Cologne, or
anywhere save to Dillenburg with His Highness."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne sat on the edge of the long box R√©n√®e was filling
with clothes. Her pale blue eyes wandered round the
room with a painful vacancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I wish I were dead," she said foolishly. "I have never
been happy."</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e looked at her with an amazement not untouched
with bitterness, for it was the wife of William of Orange
who spoke so‚Äîa woman who had everything through the
mere accident of birth, while she‚Äî‚Äî! The beautiful
young Fleming smiled ironically as she thought of herself
and her poor life.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why are you not happy, Madame?" she asked. "You
have all there is in the world‚Äîease and friends and greatness‚Äîyour
children‚Äîthe Prince."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>"Yes," said Anne, with sudden sharpness, "but I am
an ugly crooked woman whom no one loves."</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e held her breath, it gave her a strange sensation to
hear the Princess thus describe herself; she had always
thought vanity completely blinded Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You thought I did not know?" continued her mistress,
with that sudden look and tone of intelligence so painfully
in contrast with her usual wildness. "I always knew. I
had nothing from the beginning. You hated me‚Äîso did
every one. When I thought <em>he</em> loved me I nearly went
mad with joy. But he had married me for ambition, of
course."</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e, in her confusion of thoughts, felt impelled to
defend the Prince, as if, for the first time, she saw some
glimmer of justice in Anne's point of view.</p>

<p class='c000'>"These great marriages are not made for love," she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I was sixteen," remarked Anne drily. "I did not
know anything."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You could have made His Highness care," urged
R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not with this face and body," said the Princess
curtly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And he has been loyal to you," continued Anne,
"and gentle and patient."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I shall never be happy here. If he had loved me," she
said, with brutal frankness, "he might have changed me‚Äîbut
he never did‚Äîand for his kindness, did I want that?
He is kind to every one, he finds it the easier way. I have
always been curst. I wish I were dead; and now we are
ruined too."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Consider, Madame, the Prince has made these sacrifices
to help the Reformers, and you are a Lutheran."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Lutheran or Papist are nothing to me," answered
Anne, "nor God either‚Äîwhy did He make women
curst and crooked?"</p>

<p class='c000'>She lifted her head, and, seeing R√©n√®e with her arms full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>of clothes, she called out imperiously, "Put down those
things! I will never leave the Netherlands!"</p>

<p class='c000'>As she spoke the Prince entered; Anne rose and faced
him with the look of an adversary.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My wife," he said at once, "I come to implore you to
hasten."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne's face hardened into compressed lips and puckered
brows until it was like an ugly wax mask.</p>

<p class='c000'>"News?" she asked briefly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, I have received a letter from one of my agents
in Spain" (he did not mention that this agent was Vandenesse,
the King's private secretary), "and he tells me
that my arrest is resolved upon the moment Alva reaches
the Netherlands‚Äîand that my trial is not to last more
than twenty-four hours."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But they would do nothing to me," said Anne sullenly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Before God, Madame, I entreat you to hasten! Are
you not a Lutheran and the Elector Maurice's daughter,
and do you hope to stand in Alva's good graces?"</p>

<p class='c000'>A slight tremor shook Anne.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It does not please me to go to Dillenburg," she
muttered.</p>

<p class='c000'>William flushed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You remind me that I have no other house to offer
you," he said. "I must entreat your patience, Anne."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let me go to Cologne," answered the Princess. "I
think you could well spare me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is not possible. Our separation would cause a
scandal, and is there need to put our affairs in every man's
mouth? And at this juncture of my affairs I cannot well
afford two households."</p>

<p class='c000'>This drove Anne into one of her sudden furies.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah yes," she cried. "You are ruined in this miserable
intrigue! Why could you not remain loyal? This
is all the doing of Count Louis‚ÄîI always hated him; little
did you think of me when you suffered yourself to be led
away by his boy's tricks!"
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>William looked at her steadily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What I do is according to my conscience," he said
quietly, "but that I think you do not comprehend. Yet
let me tell you this: a man situated as I am, who sees
nothing but troubles before him, could find no greater
comfort than a patient wife who took her difficulties
lightly. But that comfort, I fear, I shall never have from
you."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And what comfort shall <em>I</em> get from anyone?" asked
Anne wildly.</p>

<p class='c000'>She flung into the inner chamber, harshly closing the
door after her so that the panels rattled.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e felt the tears sting her eyes at the misery, the
wretchedness of it all; what was wrong, she wondered,
that things should be like this?</p>

<p class='c000'>"See to these affairs, my child," said the Prince, pointing
to the confusion in the chamber, "we must indeed be
gone to-morrow."</p>

<p class='c000'>"All is nearly ready, Highness," answered R√©n√®e;
"the men may come when they will for the coffers. And
I think the Princess will come quietly‚Äîshe is frightened."</p>

<p class='c000'>"She is in a melancholy," said William, "she has not
all her wits. A fine discord she will strike in Dillenburg,"
he added grimly. "I had hoped, these humours would
pass with her youth, but it is not so."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne was still only twenty-four, but no one thought
of her as young.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is a sickness," answered R√©n√®e, "she is never well,
seigneur, but always ailing and often in pain."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I know, and therefore I forbear many things," he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>She looked at his face that was tired and pale but
absolutely composed and serene, and she saw that he had
long since gauged Anne's value and that she did not trouble
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are glad to return to Germany?" he suddenly
asked R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>She flushed brightly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>"I am glad to think that Your Highness will return to
the Netherlands," she answered boldly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You think I shall?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes‚Äîfor who else is there to withstand Alva and
Philip?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You still make a champion of me," he smiled. "Be-like
you think of me as a heretic?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Men call you that, Highness."</p>

<p class='c000'>"My enemies."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your friends could find no nobler name," answered
R√©n√®e.</p>

<p class='c000'>She stood erect, gazing at him, and the joy and terror
she had in his presence and her intense love for her country
and her faith fired her beauty with an ardent life that made
her glow like a brilliant flower.</p>

<p class='c000'>All her lovelinesses, always neglected and ignored, were
suddenly triumphant.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If Your Highness would but listen to the cries of the
poor Netherlanders!" she said. "They say you would
have followed Count Egmont if he had raised his standard
for the people‚Äîwill you not go on alone?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Against Philip?" William smiled. "Child, you
think too much of politics. When we are in Germany
I will find you a husband who will relieve you from this
stern service."</p>

<p class='c000'>She turned away wistfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am always overbold," she murmured; "it is my
folly."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince touched her lightly on the shoulder. "Hold
up your heart. I, too, love the Netherlands and hope to
serve them. And maybe I might accomplish something‚Äîeven
against Spain. God guides it all, surely."</p>

<p class='c000'>He left her, and R√©n√®e went on with her task, selecting,
folding, putting away; the little German girl came to
help her, and two others of the Princess's women went to
and fro the long suite of apartments with clothes and
caskets in their hands.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>The dusk fell, the candles were lit; the Ave Maria rose
from the great church of Breda, the dark closed in, and
the shutters were fastened over the spring night, and still
the preparations for departure went on from garret to
cellar.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the library the Prince was writing his farewell letters
to Egmont and Hoorne; in her chamber Anne lay prostrate
and sullen on her huge brocaded bed; in all the rooms
the servants and attendants worked, packing up the
furniture and household goods.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was much that had to be left behind. There was
much that had been utterly abandoned, as the greater
part of the rich appointments of the gorgeous Brussels
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">h√¥tel</span>, and it was but a modest train that started on the
morrow for Cleves, the first stage of the journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as they proceeded their number was continually
swelled by crowds of fugitives and refugees who threw
themselves on the protection of the Prince of Orange, and
fled from the coming of Alva, whose name was beginning
to sound over the provinces like the sound of a curse,
and whose shadow was flung dark before him, like the
shadow of death.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> PHILIP'S AVENGERS</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>From Carthagena to Genoa, hence to San Ambrosio,
over the Alps to Mont Cenis, through Savoy,
Burgundy, and Louvain came the army of the Duke
of Alva, watched by a French army, watched by a Swiss
army, taking no heed of either, steadily pursuing their
way to the rebellious provinces.</p>

<p class='c000'>At every stopping-place they were met by messages from
the Duchess, entreating them to stay, saying their coming
would unchain a war of religion, protesting against this
coming of an armed force into a country already quieted
by pacific means. Two motives influenced Margaret in
these protestations: she was indignant at being superseded
by Alva, after her long and bitter toils in the service
of her brother had at last met with some success; and now,
at the final issue, she was frightened at what putting the
provinces under Spanish soldiers might mean. She even
wrote to Philip expressing her opinion of the fatal consequences
likely to follow Alva's invasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the King took no notice of these complaints, and
Alva only smiled at the letters of an agitated woman who
was suddenly trying to quench the flame she had so
recklessly fanned, and continued his steady march towards
the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>On a hot night in the middle of August a charcoal-burner,
who lived in the forest of Thionville on the frontier
between Luxemburg and the Netherlands, was roused by
sounds unusual indeed in that solitude, and creeping out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>of his bed he came out into the moonlight, his frightened
family behind him, and, hiding behind the thick trees,
gazed down on to the road‚Äîa mere narrow defile that
ran through the immense forest, which on one side sloped
away and on the other rose into the ledge where the poor
peasant hid.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a most gorgeous night, the moon hung like a
plate of soft gold in the deep purple heavens and shed a
radiance, too warm for silver, through the close branches
of the stately trees, in full summer luxuriance, that spread
to right and left, before and behind, on all sides bounding
the vision.</p>

<p class='c000'>The air was warm but not oppressive, now and then a
little ripple of wind shook the undergrowth, the brambles,
the daisies, the poppies, the foxgloves, and the thick
fragrant grasses. The stillness had been complete, but now
it was broken by the ever increasing sound of the tramp
of feet and the jingling of harness; and soon the vanguard
of Alva's army was revealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had raised their last encampment with the rising
of the moon that they might the sooner set foot in the
Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The charcoal-burner knew nothing of this, he did not even
know whose army he looked upon; he trembled and crossed
himself and clung tightly to his children, while he crouched
down in a bed of foxgloves behind a huge beech and peered,
with an awe-struck curiosity, at this new and terrible
sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Alva's army was not large, being no more than ten
thousand men, but these ten thousand were the most
famous veterans in the world, and both their organization
and equipment were perfect, while there was no general
in the world whose fame equalled that of Ferdinando
Alvarez de Toledo, the great Duke of Alva.</p>

<p class='c000'>The vanguard of this army, as it hastened through the
forest of Thionville, consisted of two of the Italian regiments‚Äîthose
of Sicily and Naples, commanded severally by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>Spaniards, Julien, Romero, and Alfonso de Ulloa‚Äîand
considered the finest foot-soldiers in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>They marched with quick strides, their colours furled,
their general riding before them; the stout figures of the
Calabrese, the slender strength of the Sicilians, adorned
with rich arms and silk scarves and plumes of brilliant
colours, and the fierce, gay, dark faces, made a strange
picture of force and energy hastening through the lonely
night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Behind them came two companies of women, some on
foot, walking with perfect discipline and order, some
riding on the baggage waggons or the sumpter-mules.</p>

<p class='c000'>These were the camp-followers, but neither poor nor
ragged; they were as well-appointed as any well-born
lady, and many had a page or attendant; behind the
wantons rode a small company of priests with a little
escort of horsemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the Southern regiments passed; the charcoal-burner
gazed after them like one struck out of his
senses.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a distance of half a league (for the spaces between
the three divisions were being rapidly diminished as the
army neared the goal) came the next contingent, consisting
of the artillery, which jangled quickly away into
the night with rattle of wheels, crack of whip, and shout
of driver, and twelve hundred Spanish cavalry, at the
head of which rode Don Ferdinando de Toledo, the
Duke's son, and Prior of that Great Order of the Church
Militant‚Äîthe Knights of St. John‚Äîwearing the noble
vesture of his stately office.</p>

<p class='c000'>Behind him came the musketeers, all wearing inlaid
and engraved armour, and each attended, as if he had
been an officer, by a squire who bore his musket‚Äîthat
new weapon not seen before in any army.</p>

<p class='c000'>These splendid soldiers carried themselves with a great
pride, the moon glowed softly in their exquisite cuirasses,
cuisses, greaves, and helmets, which were most carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>polished; these horsemen were the only Spaniards in
the army.</p>

<p class='c000'>After them rode two Italian generals and the engineers‚Äîa
gorgeous group of officers in undress or jousting
armour, and wearing caps adorned with jewels and heron's
feathers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Next came a carriage containing Spanish priests of
high rank, then other of the Spanish horsemen, then the
baggage mules and the women.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were no less than four hundred of these on horseback‚ÄîSpanish,
Italian, and French beauties, lavishly
dressed in silk and velvet, with flowing mantles and
precious embroideries; some were veiled like modest
women, while others rode with their rich locks hanging
over their shoulders and their hard beautiful faces uncovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>One or two were singing in rather a melancholy fashion,
several sat wearily on their handsome saddles, but all,
like their meaner sisters who went afoot, conducted
themselves with order and decorum.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had passed, dazzling the eyes and bewildering
the mind of the staring charcoal-burner, there was a
short pause; then a company of light horse galloped up
out of the night, and behind them, riding more slowly,
came a single horseman.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was about sixty years of age, tall, of a slight figure,
but of an appearance of great energy and strength, controlled,
however, by a considerable stiffness of deportment
and an air of cold and repelling pride.</p>

<p class='c000'>He wore a half-suit of plain blue armour, and black
mantle, boots, and doublet; his face was extremely
narrow, his features hard, his complexion dry yet flushed,
his eyes small and dark and expressing nothing but
arrogance; a plain velvet cap concealed his hair, a long
beard of black frosted with white descended to his waist.</p>

<p class='c000'>With his long thin body, small head, narrow countenance,
and bright eyes he had a certain likeness to a snake;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>not in one lineament was there the least trace of any
soft or pleasant emotion or sentiment; he seemed a man
of ice and iron, haughty, cruel, and avaricious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Without glancing to right or left, carelessly guiding
his superb white Arab horse with one hand while the
other fingered the plain cross that hung on his breast,
this solitary rider, the great and terrible Duke of Alva,
passed on towards the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>After him came others of his especial escort of light
cavalry, then more priests and more women (so well-provided
for soul and body did Philip's armies go forth
to crush the unbeliever), then another pause, and finally
the rearguard of Lombard and Sardinian regiments,
commanded by Sancho de Lodrovo and Gonzalo de
Braccamonte.</p>

<p class='c000'>These veterans, less fine, perhaps, than the glittering
ranks of Sicily and Naples, were, nevertheless, magnificent
men handsomely armed:</p>

<p class='c000'>By the time they passed, the moon was fading, and
the dawn was creeping in pale streams of light through
the forest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The charcoal-burner crouched lower down among the
foxgloves and crossed himself fearfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the time the whole sky had changed from the soft
violet of night to the pale azure of the dawn, the last of
Alva's army had disappeared, and there remained on the
road only the straggling followers‚Äîthe peasants, who
hoped to sell their produce, eagerly whipping along their
mules; the poor who hoped for charity; the idle who
hoped for stray plunder; boys who had marched miles
from their homes in sheer aimless excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The charcoal-burner, encouraged by the sight of his
own kind, called out softly to one of the men with the
mules‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who are they, those great and wonderful fellows
who have just passed?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The other answered with some pride in his knowledge‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>"That is the mighty army of the King of Spain."</p>

<p class='c000'>"May the angels all preserve us! And where are they
going?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"To the Netherlands to avenge the insolence of the
heretics."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And he in the midst?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That was the Duke of Alva. They all have money
and pay well. If I can catch up with the camp to-night
I shall have enough to pay me for my journey."</p>

<p class='c000'>So he and his mules, laden with fruit and vegetables
and skins of wine, disappeared into the misty depths of
the forest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The charcoal-burner dragged his sleepy children out
of the foxglove bed and returned to his hut where his
wife, who was not interested in the passing army at all,
was already putting the bread and milk on the table;
and before they ate, the man made them all thank God
that they were not heretics in the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>That day Alva crossed the frontier; that night he
slept within the provinces. Scouts brought him news
that Count Egmont was riding forth to Tirlemont to
welcome him; he received the news with his usual cold
stare.</p>

<p class='c000'>Inside his plain doublet were many precious documents
written by the hand of Philip; among them were the
warrants for the deaths of Egmont, Hoorne, and the
Prince of Orange.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER I<br /> DILLENBURG</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Life in the ancestral castle of the German Nassaus
at Dillenburg was very different from what the life
in Brussels, Antwerp, or Breda had been.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old Countess of Nassau, Juliana of Stollberg, was
the head of this household, and with her lived Count John,
his wife the Landgravine Elisabeth, and their family;
here, too, resided the unmarried daughters of the house,
Juliana, and Magdalena‚Äîlately betrothed to Wolfgang,
Count of Hohenlohe; while the married daughters, Anna,
the Countess of Nassau Saarbruck; and Elisabeth, Countess
of Solms Braunfels; Catherine, Countess of Schwarzburg;
and the Countess van der Berg were continually coming
and going on visits to their old home.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was not much money and no magnificence at
Dillenburg when the eldest son, practically an exile and a
fugitive, arrived with his sickly peevish wife and his train
of a hundred and fifty‚Äîvery shorn splendour for the
Prince of Orange, but a considerable strain on the resources
of Count John.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the welcome was none the less passionately sincere
in love and pride, and William was treated by his family
with the same deference as if he had been still the favourite
of Charles V, or the greatest man in the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>His brothers, Adolphus and Henry‚Äîa youth who had just
left College‚Äîreturned eagerly to Dillenburg to join him, and
Count Louis left Brederode, who was revolving one scheme
after another that came to nothing, and hastened to Germany.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Meanwhile William waited for news from the Netherlands,
for news of the proceedings of Alva, and for answers
to the letters that he had sent to the German Protestant
Princes‚Äîthe Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of
Hesse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now at last he had begun to reap the fruit of that foresight
which had induced him to engage in his second
marriage despite the lively disapproval of Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>That marriage had been as disastrous as his worst
enemies could have hoped, but at least it had given him
some claim on the friendship of Anne's relations.</p>

<p class='c000'>William had also asked the old Landgrave Philip to send
him a Lutheran preacher, who was immediately and
joyfully dispatched, and the Prince of Orange occupied the
first leisure he had known for years in studying the New
Testament and listening to the exposition of the tenets of
Martin Luther.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Alva, Philip's swift and sure right hand, had lost no
time in striking him one blow that hit both his pride and
his affections.</p>

<p class='c000'>His eldest son, the Count of Buren, was beguiled by Alva
from school in Louvain (where William had left him,
relying on the high and ancient privileges of the University)
and sent to Spain, where he had gone a willing captive,
flattered and caressed, for he was a child and knew nothing
of his father nor of Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus the first move was to Alva, and the Prince, bitterly
wounded and outraged, had had to admit that his sagacity
had been at fault; what foolishness to rely on any charters
or privileges where Alva and Philip were concerned.</p>

<p class='c000'>He took this grief silently and applied himself to long
and careful preparations for the part he intended to take
upon himself. He was hours closeted with Count John,
hours with the Lutheran minister; his private table was
covered with papers on which theological arguments were
mingled with numerical calculations‚Äîestimates of the worth
of his now available estates, estimates even of the value
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>of his jewels and plate, rude maps of the Netherlands,
lists of the towns with their several strengths, rough
draughts of letters to the Emperor, to the King of France,
to the Order of the Golden Fleece.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was in correspondence with great persons in England
and in close touch with the Huguenots of France.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few months after his departure from the Netherlands
he had already in his hands the threads of a widespread
league against Philip, which his industry, his high prestige,
his astute statesmanship had accomplished single-handed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was he wantonly rushing into rebellion against the
man to whom he had sworn loyalty.</p>

<p class='c000'>Philip had in everything justified the suspicions of the
Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of Alva's first acts had been to arrest Egmont and
Hoorne, whom he had before caressed and flattered;
Montigny and Berghen were prisoners in Spain. Alva had
seized the keys of every city in the Netherlands. Margaret
was the mere shadow of authority, and Alva was absolute.</p>

<p class='c000'>He seemed to have but two objects‚Äîblood and gold:
the blood of the heretics, that was to smoke to heaven to
please the nostrils of the Lord; and the gold of the heretics,
which was to flow to Spain to please the eyes of the King.</p>

<p class='c000'>In both ways were the Netherlands to be drained, of life
and of treasure; and so Alva hoped to avenge the outrages
which had been offered to both spiritual and temporal
power.</p>

<p class='c000'>The estates of the Prince of Orange had been threatened
with confiscation, and he himself, together with Montigny,
Culemburg, Van der Berg, and Hoogstraaten had been
summoned to appear within fourteen days before the
Council of Troubles, an arbitrary tribunal established by
Alva which had already earned the title of the Council of
Blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince of Orange, therefore, was not organizing a
rebellion against a pacific monarch who was prepared to
leave him in peace if he remained in exile; he but struck at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>one who was striking at him, his friends, his country, with
blind, fanatical fury, a cunning treachery, a narrow cruelty
that was almost inconceivable.</p>

<p class='c000'>And in striking at William of Orange, Philip had roused
more than was in his nature to believe in, as a man intent
on killing little helpless animals may carelessly wound a
sleeping lion, whose presence he had no wit to guess at.</p>

<p class='c000'>So William, silently, made his preparations against
Spain; so the tranquil autumn and the vintage passed, and
the spring came gaily back to Dillenburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Nassau women employed themselves in household
tasks, eagerly talking together, eagerly helping the men
whenever might be, fervently attending the plain Lutheran
service in the plain Lutheran chapel, and listening reverently
to the impassioned sermons of the preacher.</p>

<p class='c000'>These days were sweet to R√©n√®e le Meung; she knew
them as only a prelude to great trouble, perhaps great
agony, yet for the moment she was happy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The women treated her kindly, she felt one of a family,
not part of the mechanism of a household; there was no
need to keep such wearing watch on Anne, who was helpless
for evil here. Every one she spoke to was of her own
faith; there was no longer in her ears the scoffs and insults
of Papists, no longer horrible tales of torture and death
repeated on every side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here were peace and kindness and affection. And if
Anne writhed under the confinement, the monotony, the
simplicity, alternating between bitter melancholy and
passionate fury, R√©n√®e found the atmosphere as refreshing
to her parched soul as water to dry lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>And her greatest joy‚Äîher secret, almost holy joy‚Äîwas
in the attitude of the Prince; for in him she discerned
now, beyond all doubt, the destined champion of her
country and her faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in the early spring that Count Louis came to
Dillenburg. He stopped one moment to receive his mother's
warm salute, then went straight to the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>William was in a room which was fitted up as a library,
a small and modest chamber near the chapel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The books on the simple shelves were mostly theological
works collected by William's father, treatises and pamphlets
in Latin and French, written when the first heat of fierce
controversy had raged over the schism in the Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the pointed Gothic window was a desk of heavy
black wood, piled with papers and furnished with a large
brass ink-pot and sand-dish and a tall silver hourglass.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the centre was a large and worn Bible.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no furniture in the room beyond a few chairs
covered with faded tapestry and the shelves of books;
the April sun, fine and clear, filled every corner of the
room and showed the dust on the books, on the floor, and
in crevices of the shelves.</p>

<p class='c000'>William rose instantly from his desk and embraced his
brother, then led him to the deep window-seat, which was
filled with red cushions from which the sun had taken the
brightness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Neither of these young men, once so splendid, were any
longer magnificent. William wore a suit of dark blue
camlet with a ruff of plain needlework, and no jewels beyond
a yellow topaz signet ring; Louis was habited in a
brown riding suit and boots dusty to the knees: he had
lately lost something of his bloom and freshness, and his
brilliant eyes were tired and shadowed; but his firm-featured,
beardless face, framed in the graceful blonde
curls, retained the old ardent charm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Round his neck hung a silver "beggar" medal and a
tiny silver cup.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Any news?" asked William, gazing at him affectionately
and still retaining his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Some news, yes. At Cleves I met the Spanish post‚ÄîBerghen
is dead," replied Louis in a moved voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dead?" echoed the Prince. "So soon?" And his
face saddened as he reflected that this was the first sacrifice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>from among the Netherland nobles who had dared to
disobey Philip. "Dead?‚Äîand in Spain!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"In a Spanish prison," amended Louis. "They say
he died of home-sickness and disappointment. God knows!
At least it is certain he is dead, and there seems little hope
for Montigny. No one believes he will ever leave Spain.
His poor wife is wearing out the altar stones with kneeling
to her saints! May they comfort her!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why would he go!" exclaimed William. "He was
infatuate, as all of them. And Egmont?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is no hope for Egmont; he and Hoorne are surely
doomed," replied the Count sombrely. "The Countess
Egmont and her children will be utterly ruined, for every
thaler he possesses is held confiscate."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And this is the reward of his loyalty," remarked
William grimly. "To what end did he stoop to play the
persecutor at Valenciennes! Yet he was always sanguine."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Even after Alva came, and others had warned him, he
would not believe. He had a sweet letter from the King,
written after the Duke sailed and complimenting him on
his loyalty‚Äîhe put all faith in that."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, Philip!" cried William, with a deep accent of
hatred.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was a trap," continued the Count‚Äî"a trap for
all of us. Granvelle and Spinosa planned it with Alva."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I know," said the Prince. "The design is to utterly
subjugate the Provinces, execute all those who were
against Granvelle, re-establish the Inquisition, exterminate
all heretics, and make the Netherlands subject appanages
of the Spanish Crown as are the Italian states‚Äîthat is
Philip's policy. Mine," he added, with a certain passion,
"will be to prevent it."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Surely you can, surely you will," said Louis, with
enthusiasm and reverence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yet do not think me sanguine," answered the Prince
gravely. "I know what I undertake. I know the might
of Spain. Egmont might have done something, but that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>chance is past. Oh, I am not sanguine! I think before
this struggle is over Granvelle may count all his enemies
among the dead. Berghen has gone‚ÄîMontigny, Egmont,
Hoorne are doomed‚Äînay, are we not all doomed?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Doomed?" repeated Louis quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"By Philip. He has judged and condemned us, and
his vengeance has many faces. If you go on, Louis, go on
as I shall, as a man devoted to a cause almost hopeless‚Äîas
one under sentence of death."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It does not frighten me," answered the young Count
simply. "I love the cause and I love the commander!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He kissed his brother's hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is some time," he added, "since I entreated to be
your lieutenant."</p>

<p class='c000'>William smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where is your 'beggars'' league now, Louis? Drowned
as it was born, in Brederode's wassail bowl! What did
those men prove? Good fellows, but none of them of any
worth save Culemburg and Ste Aldegonde."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis flushed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But I have some men gathered together," he said.
"A poor little army, it is true, but something."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is your work, not Brederode's," answered William.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Poor Brederode!" exclaimed the Count generously.
"He was brave and loyal, and now all his schemes have
failed. I think he will die of it‚ÄîI left him creeping to
Germany, a disappointed man."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Leave him; he is happier than some better men," said
the Prince. "And to our affairs. I too have been
enrolling an army‚Äîa poor thing too, refugees, mercenaries‚Äîbut
something."</p>

<p class='c000'>The two brothers looked at each other with a keen and
flashing glance.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You will invade the Netherlands?" asked Louis
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If I can get the money, I will," answered the Prince,
and he spoke quite simply, as if it was not in the least
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>a wonderful feat to even contemplate‚Äîthis marching
against the finest army in the world with a handful of raw
recruits and mercenaries.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, the money!" sighed Louis. He too was of an
heroic temper, he too took the tremendous task simply;
but he was daunted by the mention of what had completely
checked his own gallant efforts.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We need," said William, speaking with a precision
which showed that he had well studied the subject, "at
least two hundred thousand crowns. There was," he
added, with a smile, "a time when I could have raised
as much from my own estates‚Äîbut not now!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is not so much," remarked Louis hopefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Half," continued William, leaning forward and taking
some papers from under the great Bible, "I have
already had promised me from my agents in Antwerp,
Amsterdam, Leyden, Haarlem, and other great towns;
some has been promised by the refugee merchants in
England."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And for the rest?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Culemburg, Van der Berg, and Hoogstraaten will help‚Äîthe
House of Nassau must make up the balance."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis sat thoughtful, his eyes narrowed while he made
a mental calculation.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I could raise ten thousand," he said at length.</p>

<p class='c000'>William added the sum to the list he held in his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"John will help," he remarked. "And I, I will do
what I can. Would we now had the money we once
spent on pleasure‚Äîyet those were golden days, and I
regret them not."</p>

<p class='c000'>He rose and paced up and down the room, holding his
papers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There are the Huguenots under De Villars‚Äîthey
would do something. Then I think many would join us.
Alva is so hated."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis remained in the window-seat, gazing out on the
golden April day which was now fading to a close.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>"I will do whatever you tell me," he said, with a submission
that was almost childlike from one so brilliant in
achievement.</p>

<p class='c000'>A single bell sounded through the stillness of the castle.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is for the evening service," said William. "Will
you go?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Tired and dusty as he was, the Count assented.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And you?" he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>William put his papers carefully away under the Bible.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In my mother's house I may honour my mother's
faith," he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two young men went down to the chapel together.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II<br /> JULIANA OF STOLBERG</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>A few days after the return of Count Louis to
Dillenburg, a notable company was gathered in the
large council chamber. It was long since it had
served for councils, having for many a day been put to
lighter uses‚Äîfor ball, feast, and family celebration.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no magnificence save only the magnificence
of the high Gothic arches, and no splendour save only
the splendour of the windows gorgeous with the lion and
billets of Nassau in blue and yellow and the twisted lettering
of the motto of the house: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce sera Nassau, moi, je
maintaindrai</span>."</p>

<p class='c000'>A plain oak table, no longer polished, and worn to a
tint like dark silver, occupied the centre of the room; a
circle of high-backed chairs covered with fringed leather
and fastened with tarnished gilt nails surrounded the
table: the one near the window was distinguished by
arms shaped like twisted dragons, and there sat William of
Orange, with a pile of letters and papers in his hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>His dark face, his dark habit were in shadow against
the glowing light of the coloured glass; his head was
bent a little, and with his long brown fingers he absently
fluttered over the pages of the documents he held.</p>

<p class='c000'>On one side of him sat Count John and Count Louis;
on the other, Count Adolphus and Count Henry; while
beyond the five brothers were Count van der Berg, Count
Hoogstraaten, Count Culemburg, the Seigneur de Villars,
and the Seigneur de Cocqueville, the French Huguenots.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>All these gentlemen were young in years and grave in
deportment, being indeed weighted with matters of life
and death. Two of the Nassau Counts, Adolphus and
Henry, were little more than boys, the younger being but
eighteen; his bright locks, his eager ardent look, the
charm of his early morning years, made him a pleasant
picture as he gazed intently at the Prince, to whom he
bore so distinct and touching a likeness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The details of the intended raid on the Netherlands
were being discussed.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a quiet voice William had read out the sums at their
disposal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fifty thousand crowns from the great cities of the
Netherlands and the refugees in England, fifty thousand
crowns from the Prince himself, ten thousand from Louis,
thirty thousand from Hoogstraaten, thirty thousand each
from Culemburg and Van der Berg, ten thousand by a
secret messenger from the Dowager Countess Hoorne, the
desperate mother of those two doomed men, Hoorne and
Montigny, who lay, one in a Spanish, one in a Flemish
prison, ignorant of each other's fate.</p>

<p class='c000'>In addition to this, William placed on the table a list
of all his jewels, furniture, plate, dogs, falcons, pictures,
and precious apparel, such as robes trimmed with valuable
furs, laces, and costly velvets embroidered with jewels.</p>

<p class='c000'>Count John too announced that he had pledged his
estates to raise a large sum of ready money, and the
Huguenot gentlemen offered both men and gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We can give nothing but our swords," said Henry of
Nassau, looking half vexed, half smiling at Adolphus, who
added softly, "and our lives."</p>

<p class='c000'>William heard the words; he glanced quickly at his
two younger brothers, and slightly winced. From the first
moment when he had resolved to undertake this tremendous
struggle it had not been the treasure that
he had thought of, but the noble lives that might be
sacrificed. Before this dark venture on which he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>engaging was over, the House of Nassau might be stripped
of all its sons as leaves are stripped from a tree and blown
uselessly down the wind; and as for those gathered round
him now, how many might fall, even in the first shock of
battle?</p>

<p class='c000'>As for himself, he had staked everything he possessed;
on the thick sheets of paper on the table before him stood
named all his property. The sale of this would leave
him a poor, nay, almost a beggared man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet even with all these sacrifices the total sum raised
was barely sufficient for one campaign, since they had
to pay mercenaries and support them in a country already
desolate and mastered by foreign troops.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And it is Alva who is against us," said William; his
eyes gleamed as he spoke the great captain's name, and
his voice vibrated with excitement.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And behind Alva all the treasure of Spain," added
Culemburg, glancing at the list of their own poor resources.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That," said the Prince quickly, "is not so tremendous‚Äîthe
treasure of Spain. It will take all the gold of
America to govern the Netherlands as Alva means to
govern them‚Äîto maintain an army in a country ruined,
barren‚Äîthe trade lost, the wealthy fled. Alva is a poor
financier, and he will not obtain much aid from Philip, who
looks to see gold pouring from the Netherlands‚Äînot
into them. To exhaust Alva's resources is but a question
of time."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But we?" asked Louis. "Can we wait? If this
first attempt fails, can we go on?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"We can go on till we die," answered William. "There
is nothing to stop us but the failure of ourselves. There
are plenty of men and plenty of money in the world‚Äîmany
who hate Spain and who love the Reformed Faith.
We do not venture in a little cause nor a foolish one."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis looked at his brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>"For me, I shall not fail, save only by my death,"
he said.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>"I do believe it," said William warmly, "and think
the same true of all here present. Seigneurs, for yourselves
you can answer‚Äîyour cause, your faith, your country;
for the House of Nassau I can speak." He glanced at
his four brothers. "We shall not hesitate nor turn back
nor lay down our arms until these Provinces of His
Majesty be released from the desolation of the Spaniards
and the abomination of the Inquisition, or till death free
us from our task."</p>

<p class='c000'>He did not speak vaingloriously or boastfully, nor
with any arrogance or pride, but almost sadly; and on
those present, who knew how long he had deliberated,
how strenuously he had striven to bring the Government
to reason and moderation, how loath he had been to
take up arms against Philip, this solemn declaration of
his irrevocable decision had a weighty effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>They knew that he dedicated himself, his brothers, and
all the possessions of his famous house to this cause,
not with the reckless enthusiasm of the adventurer nor
with the hot-headed daring of one who had nothing to
lose, but with the serene strength of one who had been
regally great, who had owned everything the world can
offer, and who had quietly laid down all rather than
become an accomplice of senseless tyranny.</p>

<p class='c000'>He waited for no comments on his words, but selecting
a rough map of the Netherlands from the papers before
him, laid it on the table, where the bright glow of the
window flushed it gold, and indicated with his finger the
routes to be taken by the attacking forces, which were
to be divided into three, under Louis, De Villars, and
De Cocqueville, while he himself was to wait at Cleves
with a fourth contingent to follow up success or cover
defeat.</p>

<p class='c000'>"De Cocqueville by Artois with the Huguenots and
refugees‚Äîtwo or three thousand men," said the Prince,
glancing at the Frenchman, who smiled and nodded.
"Hoogstraaten with De Villars, through Juliers on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>Maestricht; Louis on Friesland, on the west‚Äîall should
be in the field by May."</p>

<p class='c000'>He leant back in his chair and folded up his papers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All these expeditions will be desperate adventures,"
he added abruptly. "You, gentlemen, will be taking
raw troops and mercenaries against the finest veterans
in the world‚Äîyet men have been victorious before with
bad tools and a good cause."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not think of failure," answered Louis, with that
eager gaiety that showed so charmingly in him; for he
was no ignorant stripling, but a brilliant, experienced
soldier. William looked at him in silence; it was in his
mind that they must think of failure, and meet it, often.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now was not the moment for doubt and discouragement,
and the native cheerfulness of the Prince made
it easy for him to assume a calm and hopeful front.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a half-laugh he handed to Louis, Culemburg, and
Van der Berg their several commissions for raising men
and levying war against Philip and his men‚Äî"to prevent
the desolation overhanging the country by the ferocity
of the Spaniards, to maintain the privileges sworn to by
His Majesty and his predecessors, to prevent the extirpation
of all religion by the Edicts, and to save the sons
and daughters of the land from abject slavery, we have
requested our dearly loved brother, Louis of Nassau,
to issue as many troops as he shall think needful." So,
still preserving the fiction of loyalty, did William defy
Philip in terms of courteous submission to His Majesty;
so he, as sovereign Prince of Orange, owning no lord,
exercised his right to levy troops and declare war.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had already refused haughtily the jurisdiction of
Alva's Council of Troubles and proclaimed that he
was only answerable to his peers, the Chapter of the
Knights of the Golden Fleece and to the Emperor; and
now he put himself even more definitely on the side of
Philip's enemies. His expression was almost amused as
he gave the three Counts the formal copies of their commission;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>his quick mind looked forward and saw that
spare, pale figure wandering round the half-built Escorial,
and his rage when he learnt that the one grandee of the
Netherlands who had escaped his far-flung net was likely
to strike a blow that would revenge all the others.</p>

<p class='c000'>The council broke up.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the gentlemen left the apartment the Seigneur de
Villars asked Count Louis, what news from the Provinces?</p>

<p class='c000'>"The last news‚Äîa week old‚Äîis but the same story,"
replied Louis: "murder, massacre, confiscation. It is
believed that the Duchess will retire to Parma, leaving
Alva absolute master, as he is indeed now. Culemburg's
palace on the horse market has been confiscated‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"As a revenge for the conspiracy that was plotted
there," added Hoogstraaten, with a smile‚Äî"the Mass on
Parma's wedding day, the banquet of the 'beggars'! Culemburg
has paid dear for a sermon and a dinner."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Brederode has paid dearer," said Culemburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is dead, is he not, your great 'beggar'?" asked De
Cocqueville.</p>

<p class='c000'>"At Castle Handeberg," answered the Nassau Count,
a little sadly. "He fell into a melancholy, and drank
himself to death; so his great shouting and fury ended in
nothing‚Äîlike a huge wind flowing aimlessly and suddenly
dropping. Alas, he would have served us well now. I am
sorry that his gaiety and his courage are overlaid with
dust for ever."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is strange to think that Brederode is silent at last,"
remarked Van der Berg‚Äî"he who talked and laughed
so well."</p>

<p class='c000'>The western light of evening filled the old, plain but
pleasant castle as the Nassau Princes and their guests
went down to the chapel, where the preacher had already
entered for the evening service.</p>

<p class='c000'>This chapel, once gorgeous with the beautiful pomp of
the ancient faith, was now entirely bare of all ornament.</p>

<p class='c000'>Plain glass filled the windows which had once glowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>with regal colours; the ordinary light of day now entered
and lit all the aisles and arches which had once been
obscured with mysterious gloom; a coat of whitewash
obliterated the paintings on walls and pillars and ceiling;
plain rows of benches took the place of carved <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prie-Dieu</span></i>
and tasselled cushions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pulpit was of simple wood, the seat of the Nassau
family directly facing it; in each place a Bible and a
Prayer Book with a broad green marker were laid.</p>

<p class='c000'>Green curtains on brass rods screened off the upper
portion of the arches, and green boughs waved against
the clear windows; the white interior of the church was
all coloured with this green reflection, which was extraordinarily
cool, quiet, and peaceful.</p>

<p class='c000'>When William and his companions entered the chapel
it was already nearly full, most of the household being
in their places.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the Nassau pew sat the Countess of Nassau, Juliana
of Stolberg, her three daughters‚ÄîMagdalena, Juliana, and
Catherine, the wife of Van der Berg.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near them were their women. Anne had not come,
being literally ill with rage at her husband's decision to
sell his property; but R√©n√®e le Meung was there. She
glanced continually at the four Nassau women, so handsome,
so modest, so fine with their simple attire and
princely carriage; she saw that the Countess of Nassau
was pale, and guessed the reason: of all who were sacrificing
to the Protestant cause and the rescue of the Netherlands,
no one was giving what this lady was‚Äîfour splendid sons
to war and peril, a fifth to possible ruin, all her own possessions,
the husband of her favourite daughter‚Äîthe wealth
and security of her house, and all her kinsmen.</p>

<p class='c000'>When William and his brothers entered and took their
places in the pew before her, she lifted her eyes from her
Bible and gazed at them with unspeakable yearning and
unspeakable triumph.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was an offering worthy to put before the Lord,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>these were men fit to be dedicated to His service: the
noble, magnificent William, the pride of his name, and
famous in Europe; the handsome Louis, gallant, pious,
intelligent, and brave; the chivalrous Adolphus in his
healthy young manhood; Henry, the graceful youth already
promising all the splendours of his race; John, resolute,
loyal, capable, who had laid down all he possessed at
the service of his brother,‚Äîtheir mother's gaze travelled
from one to the other of them as they sat before her, and
her heart contracted and her lips trembled as she wondered
when she would see them all together again‚Äîas she
wondered how many would return to her, how many would
fall in the struggle on which they were now entering.</p>

<p class='c000'>She did not complain, even in her inmost heart; the
touch of sternness that was inevitable with a sincere belief
in her austere creed strengthened her and enabled her
to be glad and proud that they were all united in a cause
she considered sacred.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was prepared to let them all go, to lose them, if
God willed, one after the other, and neither to murmur
nor lament.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet how she cared, how she suffered in the midst of
her pride and triumph, the pain that shook her as she
watched them, so young, so brilliant, so pleasant, none
present guessed save perhaps R√©n√®e le Meung, whose
senses were acute with love.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Countess knew for what reason the council had
been held to-day: she knew that in a while now all would
scatter to try the desperate chances of a desperate war,
and not by one word would she have striven to hold them
back; but as the quiet service continued, as the green
glow of the trees was changed to the westering flood of
red over those five martial figures who had once been
children on her knee, Juliana of Stolberg breathed a
prayer for them that was a prayer of agony.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the service was over, she lingered a little in the
white chapel, now filling with the dusk; her limbs trembled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>and her eyes were misty. Her daughters stayed with
her, all sad for their brothers, Catherine too for her
husband.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each woman thought of the long vista of anxious days
before them‚Äîdays of waiting, days of news perhaps worse
than waiting; days when they would remember, with such
poignant pain, this present time of peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>They slowly left the chapel, R√©n√®e behind them, unnoticed
in the shadow.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the antechamber William waited for his mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her dark eyes smiled at him, she put out her hand and
touched his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c000'>"When do you start?" she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In a week or so‚Äîwe should be all in the field by May."</p>

<p class='c000'>"All? So soon?" She said no more, and she still
smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>But R√©n√®e, the other woman who loved William, understood,
with a dreadful sympathy, what was being endured
by the Countess's brave heart.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER III<br /> HEILIGER LEE</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>By the end of April Louis of Nassau and his
army of refugees, adventurers, and mercenaries had
entered Friesland; at Appingadam he was joined
by Adolphus in command of a troop of horse, and the two
brothers advanced on Groningen, which town refused to
receive the rebels but gave them a sum of money on condition
that they renounced an attack on the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>With this much-needed treasure Louis was enabled to
keep together his troops and enrol more of the fugitives
who daily flocked to his banner, while he retained his headquarters
at Appingadam, strengthening his forces and
waiting for news of the enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Early in May, Aremberg, Stadtholder of Friesland, came
in sight of Louis' entrenchments; there was a sharp
skirmish and Aremberg fell back on Wittewerum Abbey,
where he encamped, waiting for the arrival of Count
Meghem, Stadtholder of Guelders, who was coming up
through Coeverden with reinforcements of infantry and
light horse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis was aware that Alva's two lieutenants were only
waiting to join forces to attack him, even if Aremberg did
not fall on him alone; he knew too that the troops coming
against him were four thousand of Alva's best men, including
Braccamonte's famous Sardinian regiments, and he was
keenly conscious of the wretched rabble his own troops
showed in consequence; they were mostly untrained,
mostly in poor condition, and had only been kept from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>a mutiny by the money of the city of Groningen and
Louis' acts and promises.</p>

<p class='c000'>William's brother had started on this enterprise with a
recklessness that was not impudence but heroism; he
was a good general and a fine soldier, and well knew how
desperate was his adventure with such materials, but he
had not hesitated, for to wait for more money and better
men would have been to wait for ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>Learning that Meghem had not yet arrived at Aremberg's
camp, he shifted his own position, marched three leagues
through a little forest of fir trees, and entrenched himself
near the monastery of Heiliger Lee.</p>

<p class='c000'>There he was joined by a messenger disguised as a priest
who brought him news from Maestricht.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was completely disastrous; illness had prevented
Hoogstraaten from taking his appointed command, and
the Seigneur de Villars had led the forces which were to
attack Juliers, raise the country, and secure Maestricht.
These objects had failed. Two Spanish generals, De
Lodrovo and D'Avila, had attacked and defeated him at
Dalem; all the invading force of three thousand men had
been put to the sword, and De Villars himself sent to
Brussels for execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>So ended one of the three attempts on the Netherlands.
Louis crushed the dispatch (which had been sent by one
of the Prince's secret agents in Maestricht) into his doublet,
and said not a word of its contents to any, even to Adolphus.</p>

<p class='c000'>That evening they dined in the convent of Heiliger Lee
from which the monks had fled at their approach; the
abbot had joined Aremberg at Wittewerum.</p>

<p class='c000'>The building was pleasantly situated on a slightly
rising ground which behind sloped up to a wood of short
poplars and beech; to the left was a large plain divided,
for agricultural purposes, into squares by means of ditches
or canals; before it and to the right was a vast stretch of
swampy ground which, though covered with lush green
grass, and in part transformed into pasture land, was, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>this season of the year, impassable; a stone causeway
leading to the convent crossed this deceitful morass, which
was bordered by a road winding round the wood and hill‚Äîthe
road by which Aremberg must arrive if he made an
attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis' position was as good as was possible to find in a
country so dangerous by reason of ditches and swamps,
the shoulder of the hill protected some of the troops, and
the remainder occupied the only piece of dry ground in the
vicinity; the morass stretched before their encampment
as a natural defence; the heights, too, of Heiliger Lee
(artificially created by early monks) were the only rising
portions of ground in the whole flat district which was
girdled and swamped by the overflowing waters of the
Em and the Lippe. The ground was historic; as the two
brothers wandered in the convent gardens before the
dinner hour, they reminded each other of their school
learning, when they had read of Hermann, that early Goth
who, on the very swamp at which they now gazed, had
turned back the victorious legions of Rome.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now again the Germanic people were gathered to
resist Latin tyranny and to oppose proud assumption of
universal dominion by the assertion of man's eternal right
to freedom of person and of conscience.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a fair evening, and the scene before the two young
generals was beautiful with the languid, mellow, golden
beauty of the Low Countries. The swamps, covered with
grass of a most brilliant green hue, melted to a wistful
horizon straight as the line of the sea and misted with gold
which faded into the soft azure of the heavens; the woods
were of the same hues, a sharp, bright, delicate green and
gold, dull and glowing like the tint of honey.</p>

<p class='c000'>The road and the stone causeway were warm with the
dusky golden shadow of evening; the convent buildings
also were warm and mellow in tone; the low-walled gardens
before the doors were filled with homely flowers‚Äîpinks,
stocks, and wallflowers.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>Louis leant his elbows on the wall and looked across the
low sweet prospect. His eye travelled to the plain where
his ill-equipped forces were encamped; he watched the
men moving about among the tents preparing their food,
and thought of those four thousand beaten out of existence
at Dalem, and of the Seigneur de Villars waiting to be sent
to the scaffold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis remembered him in that last Council at Dillenburg,
how he had asked about Brederode, and lamented for his
death‚Äîhe whose own days were so numbered!</p>

<p class='c000'>The Nassau Count's face hardened; who would next
pay toll to the Spanish fury?</p>

<p class='c000'>Adolphus spoke, scattering his brother's thoughts.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If they try to cross the swamp, we have them," he said
keenly, surveying the verdant treacherous ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Aremberg is Stadtholder here, he must know the
country," replied Louis; "if it were a Spanish commander
I should have different and better hopes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have good hopes," said Adolphus. He was to-night
a little quieter, graver than usual; his fair and youthful
face wore an expression of serenity and resolution Louis
had not seen there before, but he had never been with his
brother on the eve of battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis was glad he had not spoken of the news from
Juliers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Aremberg will have good hopes too," he answered
lightly. "He despises us and the 'beggars' bitterly enough.
Strange how in the old days at Brussels we rode and ate
together‚Äîwe and Meghem, and now come to this!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Aremberg is a sick man," said Adolphus. "They say
he can hardly sit his horse. I would rather die young than
grow to be sick."</p>

<p class='c000'>A white pigeon and a white butterfly took flight together
from the convent wall and flew side by side across the
swamp until they were lost in the melting mists of the
distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adolphus pointed to them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>"Like two souls departing," he said, putting back the
thick lock of hair the evening breeze blew across his eyes.
"Do you remember the skryer who foretold our fortunes
at Leipsic?" he added.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," said Louis, with a little smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is in the camp. He followed us from Groningen,
and asked me leave to join us. He was with Brederode,
he said, even to his death, then wandered in our track from
Germany. Do you think he can really read portents in the
stars?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The young Protestant general answered slowly‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"It does not seem to me that God would permit His
heavens to show forth signs for mummers to profit by; yet
these fellows have a grain of truth in their predictions‚Äîthough
maybe of the Devil; did not this man say in Leipsic
we should all die a bloody death? And who among us then
thought of war?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"He told me yesterday," said Adolphus, "that for three
nights there had been a falling star above Groningen, and
that Aremberg's hours were counted."</p>

<p class='c000'>"God's will be done," said Louis soberly; he gave
another glance at his camp and then they turned into the
convent where their simple meal was ready.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were about to rise from the table when an officer
brought into their presence a young peasant, a tall blond
Frieslander, who told them that he had been running all
day before Aremberg's army to warn them of the enemy's
approach.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Stadtholder is coming straight on you," he said
simply. "He has with him many foreign soldiers and the
six cannon of Groningen."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We," said Louis, "shall be ready to meet him."</p>

<p class='c000'>Rising, he looked into the eyes, so blue and placid, of the
young giant who had given him this valuable warning.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Can you handle a matchlock or hold a pike?" he
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Either, in the service of Your Excellency," answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>the man quickly. "Anything to give a blow to the
Spaniards. I have strong hands," and he held them
out.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis smiled, to check a sigh.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We are none of us great soldiers," he said, "but we may
be great fighters if God wills."</p>

<p class='c000'>He took the silver "beggar medal" from his neck and
gave it to the Frieslander, bidding the officer who had
brought him to enroll him in some company which was
not full strength.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young general and his brother then threw their
mantles about them and, descending the hill, went on foot
among the encampment, exhorting and encouraging the
men (who now were enthusiastic enough), and disposing the
troops.</p>

<p class='c000'>The motley army was arranged in two battalions on the
plain where they had encamped, each squadron flanked
by musketeers and one protected by the base of the hill
on the brow of which was placed some light-armed troops,
at once the decoy and the shield of the main army.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most dangerous position was assigned to the cavalry;
this, under the command of Adolphus, was in the vanguard
of all, directly facing the wood-bordered road along which
the Spaniards would approach.</p>

<p class='c000'>When all arrangements were complete and all the officers
had received their instructions at the hastily called field
council, the brothers returned up the hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stars were now beginning to fade in the light of a
pallid dawn, the woods were hushed, the fields serene;
the bodies of men moving about to take up their positions
were indistinct black masses in the obscurity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis felt his blood beat strongly; he was about to
strike the first blow in the cause to which his House was
now pledged; tremendous results, moral and material, hung
on the issue of to-morrow's battle, and there was almost
everything against him.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he went to change into his complete armour he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>fell on his knees on the bare floor of the convent room and
prayed‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"God, as we fight not for our own profit nor glory but for
thy poor people, forgive us all our loves and our hates, our
lusts and all our mistreadings, and let those who fall to-morrow
die in thy mercy."</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had armed he dismissed his pages and went
down to where Adolphus already waited in the convent
garden.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young Count wore a suit of black mail with a little
scarlet plume like a burst of flame in his casque, and across
his heart a scarf of that orange colour, so bright and deep,
that it was frequently mistaken for the scarlet sash of the
Spanish officers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis' harness was of uncoloured steel; he too wore the
orange scarf, the tasselled ends of which fell to his thigh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the fragrant flower-beds two grooms held the two
black horses of the brothers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The light had now strengthened so that they could
distinguish the pikemen from the musketeers on the plain
below, and discern the sutlers hastening to the rear with the
baggage waggons.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adolphus glanced at the banners which were being displayed
in the still air, all of them glittering with gold and
silk which traced, he knew, patriotic and bold inscriptions;
then he watched with interest his own banner being brought
up the hill by a galloping horseman.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis was straining his eyes down the darkling road
where Aremberg was almost due.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He will wait for Meghem, who cannot be a day's march
behind," he said anxiously; "when he sees how we are
entrenched he will skirmish and wait."</p>

<p class='c000'>"God be entreated," said Adolphus, "that he attacks
us."</p>

<p class='c000'>They mounted, and were scarcely in the saddle before
news came from the outposts that Aremberg was in sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The banner of Adolphus now waved at the head of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>little troop of horsemen (not more than three hundred)
who waited on the hill to take up their position.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adolphus still looked at this banner; the morning
breeze caught the folds and blew them out, showing the
arms of Nassau with the mark of cadency of the fourth son
and the words, "<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je Maintiendrai</span></i>," together with the
inscription which was the motto of Louis' army, "<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc
aut nunquam, recuperare aut mori</span></i>."</p>

<p class='c000'>The brothers now, by a common instinct, turned to each
other and clasped hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two fine young faces, so alike in feature and expression
in the stern frame of the open casque, gazed at each
other with a wistful and silent affection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their hands loosened and they moved away, when
suddenly Adolphus turned back, and, dropping the reins,
threw his right arm round Louis' neck with a womanly
gesture and kissed him; then at a gallop he swept away,
put himself at the head of his little troop, and led them down
the hill to their desperate and perilous position.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IV<br /> THE FIRST BATTLE</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>Aremberg and his men came in sight of the
"beggars," opened fire on the light troops on the hill
from the Groningen cannon, then paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis of Nassau, waiting at the head of the main body
of his army, felt his heart sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>He discerned that the Stadtholder had noticed that
to carry the rebels' position he must needs cross the swamp,
and that he preferred to skirmish and wait for Meghem
with reinforcements.</p>

<p class='c000'>An hour of the bright morning passed heavily by;
then, to the intense relief of Louis, Aremberg again opened
fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>The impatient Spanish officers had reproached the
Netherlander for his slowness and caution; they had
no wish to share glory and spoils with Meghem's men;
they believed that the "beggars" would fly at sight of them;
they even taunted Aremberg. Braccamonte, the general
of the Sardinian troops, dared to suggest that the
Stadtholder, like his rebellious countrymen, was at heart
a heretic.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aremberg, broken by illness, stung and inflamed by
the Southern insolence, gave orders for an immediate
attack‚Äîorders that were against his own knowledge and
experience and against the trend of all Alva's advice.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the guns of the city of Groningen again opened fire,
and their sound was music in the ears of the rebel commander,
and the acrid smell of the powder, sweeter than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>the fresh perfume of the flowers opening to the early
morning in the convent garden.</p>

<p class='c000'>The light force which had received the fire now fled
from their position.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis smiled, keenly watching the enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again there was a pause in the royal ranks; again
Aremberg suggested a stratagem and the dangerous
nature of the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Spanish officers were now beyond control.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seeing the flight of the troops on the hillside (a flight
that was, as Aremberg suspected, a snare), they believed
the whole rabble of the "beggars" were in a rout before
them, and rushed forward to attack and disperse the two
squadrons of the main army.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they dashed from the road and the wood, brandishing
their swords and shouting to each other, man after man
plunged into the morass, the treacherous grass gave way
beneath them, while the deep pools left by the peat
gatherers sucked in others to their necks.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments the entire advance guard of the
Spaniards was entangled, helpless, and perishing in the
swamp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis now ordered up his musketeers, who opened a
quick fire on the struggling enemy and drove them back
again into the marsh.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile, Braccamonte was bringing up his rearguard
to the rescue. Louis, perceiving this, sent his concealed
battalions round the base of the hill to cut off the
Spanish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Braccamonte, finding himself ambushed, and fresh
contingents of the Netherlanders pouring in on his ranks,
utterly lost his courage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Shouting confused orders to his troop he turned and fled.</p>

<p class='c000'>His men, surprised, left without a leader, were instantly
driven back by the "beggars" and fell in helter-skelter
confusion on to those already entrapped in the morass.</p>

<p class='c000'>The battle field was now one red carnage; the verdant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>fields of grass were broken into trampled slime that disfigured
the gay armour of the dead and dying Sardinian
soldiers, whose dark faces were twisted into an expression
of wrath and amazement.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stagnant peat pools glowed horrid with blood,
the once pure air smelt foul with smoke, the soft sounds
of bird and insect were changed for broken curses, shouts
of despair, and gasped prayers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The proud, insolent, and arrogant troops of Spain knew
themselves completely scattered and beaten by the rebels
at whom they had so jeered and laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis, gathering together the remainder of his men,
dashed forward with weapons and banners uplifted, and
fell upon the bewildered fugitives.</p>

<p class='c000'>Aremberg had watched the troops, who had refused
to listen to his orders, go to their steady defeat; when
Braccamonte, riding hard for safety, dashed past him, a
bitter smile curled his pale lip.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Save yourself!" shouted the Spaniard.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Netherlander, at whose courage the Southerns
had mocked, never left his post.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw perfectly that the day was lost; his men were
being cut to pieces before his eyes, his officers had fled;
under his own command he had only a few horsemen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turning his gaze from the bloody <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">m√™l√©e</span> where Louis
was driving before him the boasted Sardinian regiments,
Aremberg looked to the road, which was barred by
Adolphus and his horsemen who still presented unbroken
ranks though they had received the first shock of the
artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The few officers left in attendance on the Stadtholder
urged his immediate flight along the road he had just
traversed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"How shall I account for this day's work to Alva?"
answered the Netherlander sternly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rising in his stirrups he called to his men to follow
him, and hurled himself on the young Nassau.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>The two leaders singled each other out; they had last
met in the tennis court at the Nassau palace in Brussels.</p>

<p class='c000'>They smiled at each other, and both fired; Aremberg
received the ball in his side, but fired again, then struck
with his sword at the flame-like plume on the black
casque.</p>

<p class='c000'>It dipped and fell backwards; at the same moment
a rush of "beggar" cavalry drove the Stadtholder before
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked round, and perceived that all his men had
fled save a few attendants; he had been shot twice
through the side, his disease bowed him to the saddle
with pain, the weight of his armour was almost intolerable;
he cast away his helmet whose protection he
despised, and retreated slowly, keeping his face to the
enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>A musket ball struck his horse, which fell under him;
two attendants picked him up and dragged the animal
to its feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>It staggered a few paces, then fell dead.</p>

<p class='c000'>A second time Aremberg got to his feet; two rebel
troopers approached him, he shot both, and continued
to limp along the stone causeway on which the fresh
blood was drying in the May sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw a large body of the enemy coming passionately
behind him, and dragged himself painfully off the road
on to a little meadow that sloped to the wood.</p>

<p class='c000'>There he stood at bay leaning his back against a little
fir tree that could hardly support his weight, and wiping,
with the ragged ends of his sash, the cold sweat from his
brow and the blood from his sword.</p>

<p class='c000'>The enemy soon discovered him‚Äîthere was half a
regiment of them‚Äîhe gathered all his strength to straighten
his body that he might meet them standing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another shot struck him, he fell on his knees, still
wielding his sword‚Äîone against many; one officer cried
out to spare him, for it was the Stadtholder, but even as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>he spoke Aremberg fell, shot through the throat, sinking
on his own sword which broke and fell beneath him.</p>

<p class='c000'>They picked him up and wrapped him in a cloak, and
carried him through the morass filled with his dead soldiers
to the victorious Louis of Nassau.</p>

<p class='c000'>That young general was flushed with hope; he had seen
the veteran troops of Spain go down before the onslaught
of the "beggars" and the Nassau arms wave above the field
of victory.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun was only just beginning to slant in the heavens,
and there was not one of all the boastful hosts of that
morning to fire a shot or raise a sword for Spain.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the dead general was laid at his feet, Louis uncovered.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He should have been spared," he said, in a moved voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>They lifted up the mantle and Louis looked down at the
fiery Stadtholder now mangled with shot and sword.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He was too good to be Alva's pawn," he said. "Such
bravery went ill with such a cause."</p>

<p class='c000'>He ordered the body to be carried up to the convent,
and sent a messenger to his brother; he was himself
turning up the hill when the clear challenge of advancing
trumpets came across the wood.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Meghem!" cried Louis, and hastened back to the
head of his troop.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in truth the Stadtholder of Gueldres; Louis
hastily called off the pursuers and, in the fear of another
attack, drew back his entire force on to the dry ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Count Meghem was alone; his troops had been
too exhausted to push on; he, however, with a small bodyguard,
had hurried from Zaidlaren where he had found a
letter from Aremberg bidding him hasten.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before he reached the encampment of the "beggars" the
stream of fugitives told him of disaster; from some
flying Sardinians he learnt of Aremberg's utter defeat and
death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Wild with fury he pushed recklessly on, until he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>able to discern with his own eyes the distant swamp where
had been engulfed the veterans of Spain, then turning his
horse's head he pressed back to Zaidlaren and ordered
his men to fall back and secure Groningen, in which city
he sat down to write the news to Alva.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis, secure that there would be no further attack,
now occupied himself in seeing to the troops and ordering
the disposition of the wounded, who were not numerous,
though more than a thousand of the enemy had been slain.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the hour of sunset when he returned to the
convent; he expected there to find his brother, for whom
he had repeatedly asked, but whom he had not seen since
the battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>He believed that Adolphus must have gone in pursuit
of Braccamonte's flying battalions. With a sigh of fatigue
he took off his casque and gloves and called for water and
for his page to unbuckle his armour.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where is the Count Adolphus?" he asked again,
looking round him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The officers who filled the chamber were silent; then
one of them drew Louis to the door of an inner room which
had been a monk's cell.</p>

<p class='c000'>This little apartment was flooded with light which
poured through the dancing green branches of the fruit
trees without and was musical with the evening song of
birds.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only furniture was a chair, a table, and a bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the chair was a splendid stained sword, on the
table a black casque with a flame-like plume, and on the
bed something wrapped in the banner with the Nassau
device which had waved that morning at the head of
Adolphus' little troop of horse.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis could read quite plainly the words, "<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nunc aut
nunquam, recuperare aut mori</span></i>,"‚Äîthey were slightly sprinkled
with blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>And at the bottom of the bed the banner lifted, showing
the soles of two mailed feet.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>For a moment Louis felt his courage and strength leave
him; he leant against the door-lintel as weak as a sick girl.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, "He is dead," he said; "why was I not told?"
and with a firm step he approached the bed, and turned
back the silk fold of the banner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young man lay with his head turned towards the
wall. Aremberg's sword, cutting through steel and leather,
had cloven the fair curls and the youthful forehead an
inch deep; the reverently placed linen bandage was
crimson with blood, and the long locks were clotted and
tangled; the lips were strained into what seemed a stern
smile, and the head had fallen so that the chin was raised
haughtily. The orange scarf was pierced by a bullet
that had entered under the edge of the cuirass, above this
wound the young warrior's fine hands had been crossed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis gazed long and earnestly, recalling every word of
the youth's speech last night, every gesture, recalling his
last embrace that morning‚Äîand the victory, bought with
this dear blood, became as nothing to Louis of Nassau.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first toll had been paid; very early in the fight had
it been exacted; with the first crossing of swords a Nassau
had laid down his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis bowed his head as he replaced the banner fold
over the dead features, and his eyes swelled and burnt
with tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two of Adolphus' officers came softly forward now,
gathering courage to speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was the Stadtholder slew His Excellency‚Äîthey
came together through all their troop‚Äîthe Count fell, very
valiantly wounded, at the first onslaught‚Äîhis two esquires
were shot by Count Aremberg also."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We brought him here," added the other, "not to
disturb your lordship with grief until the fight was over."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis did not answer; he stood heavily, looking at the
straight outline beneath the banner and thinking of the
gallant figure who had kissed him that morning before
the battle, and of the Prince at Cleves and the women at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Dillenburg waiting for news, to whom would come this news‚Äîthis
and the news from Juliers which Adolphus had never
known.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barren and small seemed his victory to Louis, and heavy
and mysterious the ways of God.</p>

<p class='c000'>He left the little chamber, closing the door gently as if
he feared to disturb his brother's solemn sleep, and went
out into the still garden, now flushed rosy from the
setting sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>There against the wall leant a miserable figure, Dupr√®s
the skryer.</p>

<p class='c000'>He glanced furtively and fearfully at Louis, yet with a
pleading look like a dog waiting to be called.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis started at sight of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, you!" he exclaimed; "one of your prophecies
has been fulfilled!"</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s abased himself before the young general.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I knew," he said humbly. "But, seigneur, I never
told him‚ÄîI saw one star fall for Count Aremberg and
one for <em>him</em>‚Äîbut <em>he</em> knew without my words."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, I think he knew," replied Louis; he looked
keenly at the half-starved, ragged figure of the refugee.
"And when shall I join him, wise fellow?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Dupr√®s crouched away.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The contest will outlast all the warriors," he muttered,
"and your horoscope is more dreadful than his‚Äîbut how
do I know? I cannot read the heavens as I could!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is no need to look in the heavens for my portents,"
said Louis, as if speaking to himself, "they are
blazed abroad before the eyes of men very clearly."</p>

<p class='c000'>The golden dusk faded and darkness closed over Heiliger
Lee, soft clouds passed over the setting sun which pierced
them with level rays like spears; the dead men in the
morass were hidden, the moving light of lanterns crossed
and recrossed the victorious camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>A mist, white and trembling, rose from the swamp and
obscured the roadway; the young trees in the forest,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>shivered and faded to a dark hue against the last pearly
glow of the west.</p>

<p class='c000'>The birds were silent in the fruit garden, and all the
flowers were closed away and hidden in the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Count Aremberg lay lonely with a crucifix on his breast
and his cloak folded straight; but throughout the night
Louis kept company with his brother, kneeling on the
boards beside his bed and wetting the blood-stained banner
with his tears, while the heads of the two young warriors,
still so alike, rested for the last time on the same pillow,
touched, for the last time, cheek to cheek and lip to lip.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER V<br /> NEWS FROM THE NETHERLANDS</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>The news of the dear-bought victory of Heiliger Lee
was late in coming to Dillenburg; it was soon
followed by the tale of the complete rout and loss
of the third party of the invaders, who had invaded Artois
under the Seigneur de Cocqueville. He and his entire force
had been cut down at St. Val√©ry, and the survivors of the
defeat had been instantly hanged.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Brussels, too, came other news, as disastrous as
sad. Alva's wrath had found a swift vent; the impudence
of the "master beggars," as Meghem had called them,
who had dared to defeat Alva's veteran troops and slay
his general, was cruelly revenged on those in Alva's power
who were suspected of sympathy with the rebels.</p>

<p class='c000'>The members of the House of Nassau and their adherents
were banished on pain of death, and their property confiscated.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the ruins of the Culemburg Palace, which he had
burnt to the ground, was erected a pillar commemorating
the hatching and overthrow of the "beggar" conspiracy
which had begun at the famous banquet held between
their walls; and before this desolated spot, eighteen
nobles and gentlemen were publicly executed, their heads
and bodies afterwards being fastened to stakes and left to
moulder on the horse market.</p>

<p class='c000'>And a few days later Egmont and Hoorne were brought
to Brussels, and Alva filled in the blank death-warrants
signed by Philip and brought from Spain, with the names
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>of two of the most illustrious men in the Netherlands
and the most obstinately loyal to Spain of all those Netherland
nobles who had hated Granvelle and served Philip.</p>

<p class='c000'>And on the sixth day of June the most awful blow yet
struck at the Netherlands fell, and Lamoral Egmont,
Prince of Gravern, Stadtholder of Flanders, victor of St.
Quentin and Gravelines, and Philip Montmorency, Count
Hoorne and High Admiral, both councillors of the Netherlands
and Knights of the Golden Fleece, were publicly
executed in the great square at Brussels.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole country shuddered to the heart, and the hatred
of Alva grew to a passion and a fury.</p>

<p class='c000'>There came other news to Dillenburg, to agonize Count
John and the waiting women there‚Äînews of more obscure
victims. A lady and her servant who two years before had
struck an image of the Virgin with a slipper were drowned
by the hangman in a hogshead on the scaffold; a Lutheran
who had died in prison was dragged to the place of execution
and beheaded with his companions; people were
arrested by the tens, the fifties, the hundreds, and put to
death without trial.</p>

<p class='c000'>Flight was no longer possible, as the ports were closed
against heretics; trade was at a standstill, commerce
at an end; all industries were destroyed, agriculture
ruined; the rich properties had been all confiscated or
plundered by Noircarmes, Meghem, and their followers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great nobles had perished or were in exile, and the
nation lay stunned and bleeding before her slaughterers.</p>

<p class='c000'>In every town, in every village, new scaffolds were built,
new fires lit; in every field and orchard the festering bodies
hung; on every high road wandered destitute, half-crazed
survivors, homeless and bereaved.</p>

<p class='c000'>The death-bell was now the only music in a land once
given to merriment, and the only dancing that of the dead
swinging and shaking in their chains on gibbets, stakes,
and trees; the great squares of the great cities, once
worn smooth by the passing of thousands of busy feet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>were now covered with rank grass and weeds, which were
only disturbed by the tramp of the soldiery or the feeble
steps of some half-starving wretches creeping into hiding.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only the churches remained wealthy amid the poverty,
only the priests and the Spaniards remained gorged and
fat among the miserable and ruined; for while Netherland
blood watered Netherland earth, Netherland gold streamed
into Spanish pockets.</p>

<p class='c000'>So had the Duke of Alva redeemed his boast that he
would "tame these men of butter." So with the sword,
the fire, the rope, the axe, he strove to uproot and destroy
the seed Martin Luther had planted too deep for any man's
uprooting and destroying.</p>

<p class='c000'>The messenger who brought the news of the Artois
disaster to Count John, and also dispatches from William,
who was holding his position as well as was possible, was
Francis Junius, the young minister who had preached in
the now destroyed Culemburg palace on Parma's wedding
day.</p>

<p class='c000'>This man, who was absolutely without fear (on one
occasion he had preached in a room lit by the flames of
fellow-heretics perishing at the stake without), had been in
Brussels, and had actually mingled with the crowd that
had been a horrified witness of the death of Hoorne and
Egmont.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, after wandering through the desolate country and
administering such comfort as he was able to the persecuted
people, he had joined William at Cleves and, by him, been
sent to Dillenburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Junius had left Count John, Juliana of Stolberg
sent for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found her in a quiet room of the castle with her three
daughters, Anne of Saxony, the Countess of Hoogstraaten,
and several of her women.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chamber was hung with worsted tapestry in sombre
and faded hues; against this background the group of
women, all in the dull black of mourning, with black caps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>on their fair hair and white ruffs surrounding their fair
faces, made a startling picture. She in the deepest mourning
of all was Hoogstraaten's wife; her dress was dull, without a
touch even of white, for the Countess Hoogstraaten was
the sister of Count Hoorne. She was seated next the
Countess van der Berg, and the two were embroidering
a child's dress with white and black thread.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Princess of Orange, pale and haggard in the bitter
black robes, played with a little white dog that lay on her
knee; R√©n√®e, also in mourning, sat on a low stool beside
her mistress.</p>

<p class='c000'>Francis Junius was also in a plain black gown a little worn
and rusty, and a linen band without lace.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was not discomposed by the presence of all these
great ladies, but saluted them with the civil calm that was
his habitual manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Countess of Nassau rose and received him with a
sweet courtesy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You come from my son," she said, as she set him a
chair with her own hands, "from the Prince of Orange?
If you are not fatigued, I would hear some news of
him."</p>

<p class='c000'>The slim young minister sat gravely facing the semicircle
of ladies; his worn and hollow face bore traces of
disease and anxiety, but was animated with ardour and
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Prince is very well, gracious Madame, and bore
most valiantly the grievous news. He is engaged in raising
fresh levies for another attempt on the Netherlands. He
sends these letters to your princely self and to Her Highness
his wife."</p>

<p class='c000'>With movements as precise as his words he delivered the
letters to the ladies. The Countess slipped hers into the
bosom of her dress; the Princess's letter remained on her
lap, on the back of the little dog.</p>

<p class='c000'>Francis Junius kept a reserved silence, as if waiting his
dismissal, while the young women whose husbands and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>brothers were fighting in the cause he preached gazed at him
with wide eyes of sympathy and awe.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Juliana of Stolberg wished to hear more of that
country where now all her interests were so passionately
centred.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Tell us," she said, with a sad, gentle earnestness, "of
the Netherlands."</p>

<p class='c000'>The preacher flushed and started from his abstraction.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of the Netherlands?" he repeated. "Alas, I have
seen nothing in the Netherlands you or any lady would
care to hear."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you think we are so weak-hearted?" smiled the
Countess, pointing to the mourning of all. "What we have
endured and what we must endure, our thoughts and our
anxieties, serve to steel us."</p>

<p class='c000'>Her lips trembled and she put out her hand to clasp the
sympathetic hand of her daughter Catherine, which crept
on to her knee.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Did you see my son Adolphus before he died?" she
asked in a firmer voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, Madame‚Äîbut I have heard of the great honour
he had in his death. And I heard that the Count Louis
was doing very wonderfully and resolutely with his little
means."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He had always a high, hopeful heart," replied the
Countess, "and a very gallant way of cheerfulness. God
grant that it be not overthrown nor dimmed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The House of Nassau," said the preacher, "is greatly
blessed by all the poor people of these unhappy provinces‚Äîin
that noble name alone," he added, with reverence,
"they place their hopes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"My sons can do much, not everything," answered
Juliana of Stolberg. "The people too are valiant and
patient, and fearful of God‚Äîgive credit to the people and to
such men as yourself, sir."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I?" he exclaimed, in genuine astonishment. "I am as
helpless before Alva as a straw before the wind!"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>Hoogstraaten's wife spoke; her voice was grave, in tone
like that of the Admiral, her brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But you have been in great peril, there is a price on your
head, and yet you stayed?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, that, yes," he admitted simply, as if these things
were a matter of course.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why did you stay?" asked Catherine van der Berg
earnestly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was the land where I was sent to labour, Madame,
and perhaps I have been some use‚Äîto comfort one on his
way to martyrdom, to console the bereaved, to utter a
prayer over an unconsecrated grave, to encourage the
soldiers of Prince William."</p>

<p class='c000'>His expression became sad and thoughtful, and he bent
his head as if it was heavy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is all one can do," he added wistfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is enough," said Juliana of Stolberg. "God has
guided your steps that you have come safely through such
dangers."</p>

<p class='c000'>Junius did not reply; he knew that he was doomed
sooner or later to the torture and the stake, for he did not
falter from his determination to continue his simple and
heroic ministrations in the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You saw the executions in Brussels?" asked Lenore
Hoogstraaten in a low tone. "You saw Count Egmont
die? And the Admiral?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," replied the minister. "He died bravely in his
mistaken faith and his mistaken loyalty."</p>

<p class='c000'>Countess van der Berg had known the brilliant Egmont
in the old glorious days, and she asked with a fearful
curiosity after the last moments of that unfortunate
grandee, looking tearfully the while at Hoorne's sad
sister.</p>

<p class='c000'>Junius answered in a low voice, quietly giving his impressions
of that last scene as he had witnessed it from
the crowd. He was not greatly moved by what he recited;
his fiery, single-minded piety had never had anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>but contempt for such as Egmont, and he had seen more
horrible things by far than the death of that nobleman.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He came walking very composedly. The scaffold was
covered with black cloth, with two black velvet cushions.
There were Spanish soldiers round, three thousand of them.
I think there were great fears of a rescue. It was hot
weather, and the Count came about midday, when the sun
was strong; he had asked, I heard, that he might die first.
I was close enough to see him quite clearly. His hair was
almost white, and he looked very tall; he wore a crimson
velvet robe with a black velvet cape, and underneath one
could see the badge of the Golden Fleece and his doublet
cut away about the neck‚Äîby his own hand, I think.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He made no speech, but walked up and down twisting
a handkerchief in his hand. He seemed very passionate,
and showed rage and despair, asking, I believe, to the very
last if there was not to be a pardon.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He disarranged himself and took off the badge of the
Fleece, kissed the crucifix the Bishop of Ypr√®s gave him,
and knelt.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Spanish captain gave a signal, and I saw the executioner
spring out from under the scaffold cloth, and it
was over very swiftly."</p>

<p class='c000'>The women remained pale and silent, only Hoogstraaten's
wife asked, "And Hoorne‚Äîmy brother?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Admiral was more unmoved. He was all in black,
and conducted himself without passion save when he saw
his escutcheon hanging reversed on the scaffold, when he
protested hotly. He looked on the body of Egmont, then
wished the crowd happiness, and begged them to pray for
his soul‚Äîwhich I, for one, have done," added Junius
simply. "He was not wept for like Count Egmont, but
I think he was the better man."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He lived, and died, gloomily," said the Countess
Hoogstraaten. "He had no joy in wife or child. I wish
I had been with him at the end."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Even in his coffin he was lonely," answered Junius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>He lay in Ste Gudule, and no one went near him; but
when Egmont was in St. Clara you could not move for
the crowd weeping and praying. Yet, Madame,"‚Äîhe
turned to Hoorne's sister,‚Äî"the Admiral will always have
the greater honour before God."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And the Countess Egmont?" asked Juliana of Stolberg.</p>

<p class='c000'>"She and her children were in the utmost poverty, for
every thaler he possessed was confiscate. The day of the
execution they were supperless, and fled to a convent.
Alva, it was said," smiled the preacher, "recommended
them to Philip's charity."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Nassau ladies exchanged commiserating glances,
but Anne looked coldly; the Countess of Egmont had
always been an object of her dislike and envy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is a good lesson to one who was ever over-proud,"
she remarked.</p>

<p class='c000'>These harsh words, the first that she had uttered since
Junius entered her presence, caused the preacher to look
at her with a stern surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You think I am uncharitable?" commented Anne
boldly, returning his gaze with all her bitter, rebellious
discontent unveiled in her heavy eyes. "But I am one
who has lost as much as Countess Egmont in this miserable
'beggar' war."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Countess of Nassau gave her a look of austere reproach.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Are you not ashamed to speak so, you who have a
husband, a home, and friends, while she is an outcast exile?
Are you not ashamed to speak so before the sister of
Hoorne and Montigny?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"My husband! My home! My friends!" muttered
Anne, and she bent over the little dog, clutching it till it
yelped, and William's letter fell to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e picked it up, the blood receding from her face
as she touched the inscription he had written, the wax
and cord he had sealed, and her mind pictured him in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>the midst of his pitiful little army, harassed with a thousand
cares, penning this letter to an unworthy woman.</p>

<p class='c000'>Juliana of Stolberg turned again to the young preacher.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You will stay with us a while at Dillenburg," she said,
"and, after all your labours, rest?"</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled at the idea that rest was any part of his life.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Indeed I must return to the Netherlands," he answered.
"I shall go back to meet the Prince at Strasburg, and
afterwards to the Provinces."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is to step into hell's mouth," said the Prince's
mother, "but it is so noble a resolve that I am ashamed
to endeavour to dissuade you."</p>

<p class='c000'>They talked a little longer about his work among the
persecuted Netherlanders, and then he left them to prepare
himself for the service he was to take that evening in the
chapel.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he had left a silence fell over the little group of
black-clad women; only Anne, who was like a firebrand
of discord in that peaceful household, was restless.</p>

<p class='c000'>She threw the dog off her knee at last and limped fretfully
about the room; with feverish fingers she tore open
the Prince's letter, then cast it down.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Countess noticed this and flushed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What have you read that displeases you?" she asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What can I read that will please me?" flashed Anne.
"What good news can come from a man ruined by his
own folly?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You speak of my son," returned the Countess, trembling.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I speak of the man who has reduced me to beggary,"
cried the Princess passionately. "And I will use my
tongue as I list; it is you who do not use the respect you
should‚Äîall of you‚Äîlittle nobles that you are, to the
Elector Maurice's daughter."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Countess rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Had you been <em>my</em> daughter, you had been better
bred," she said, "and learnt many a lesson at the rod's
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>end. You may be finely born, but you are foully trained,
or else you are mad, God pity you! If you were not my
son's wife, I should have other things to say to you; since
you are, I beg you to stay apart from me, for my soul
is too troubled to support cursed humours."</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne was silenced. The Countess, like William, could
overawe her if she chose. The Princess shuddered with
suppressed passion and, as always when defeated, hurried
from the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Countess seated herself, pale with distaste; such
scenes as these, and worse, were but too common now.
Anne had threatened Count John with a dinner-knife,
and again and again wounded her attendants with any
weapon she could lay her hands on; R√©n√®e bore a bruise
on her forehead where the Princess had struck her with
a wine-bottle.</p>

<p class='c000'>"She is mad," said Magdalena, with the indignant
frankness of youth. "She should be put away; indeed
she should."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think she is mad," admitted R√©n√®e slowly and
humbly. She had so completely assumed the burden
of Anne's life that she felt as if Anne's faults were her
own; she rose now to follow the Princess.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Stay here, you poor child," said the Countess of
Nassau tenderly.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e thanked her affectionately, but hastened after
her mistress.</p>

<p class='c000'>She dared not leave Anne alone; it was always before
her, a constant terror, that Anne might escape to Cologne
and utterly disgrace the Prince; and she felt intensely
the responsibility of being the only one who knew how
low Anne had descended, even in the days of her prosperity.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VI<br /> THE PRINCE AT BAY</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>In that July, William moved to Strasburg, steadily
and boldly preparing his advance against the
Spaniards, his daring inroad into the Netherlands.
He had now no allies save his brother Louis, who, in
desperate want of money, with mutinous troops, was
using all his brilliant audacity and resource to keep his
men together in Friesland, where his barren victory of
Heiliger Lee had been followed by no fruits save what
little money he could wring from the Abbots of Wittewerum
and Heiliger Lee and the forced supplies obtained from
the inhabitants of the district.</p>

<p class='c000'>And against this force of ill-disciplined, ill-fed, mutinous,
and ill-equipped troops, held together by one man's
courage and influence, Alva himself was marching with
fifteen thousand of his veteran regiments.</p>

<p class='c000'>William, pressing forward his own preparations, using
all his eloquence, all his energy to raise new levies, to
obtain money, hardly dared to think of Louis awaiting
the approach of Alva in the marshes of Friesland.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had heard of the entire failure of the two other
expeditions he had so carefully and adroitly planned,
the utter annihilation of the forces of De Cocqueville
and De Villars, and he had received an even more cruel
blow in the news of the death of Adolphus; but in his
own task he did not hesitate for a moment in his strenuous
preparations, nor in his unfaltering endeavours.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had now every one against him save his own family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>and a few faithful friends, such as Hoogstraaten and
Culemburg. The Emperor, at first favourable to his
enterprise, was now drawing closer in an alliance with
Spain, and ordered the Prince to abandon the cause of
the Netherlands on pain of forfeiting all his Imperial
privileges and dignities; and the German Princes, from
whose alliance William had hoped so much, became
daily colder and colder in the cause of the unhappy
Provinces.</p>

<p class='c000'>And it was a cause that might seem indeed hopeless;
so mighty and terrible was Alva, so supine, so stifled,
so exhausted, so crouching the wretched people he had
crushed beneath his armed feet and bound and gagged
with the chains and bits of the Holy Inquisition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the executions of Egmont and Hoorne the heart
of the country seemed to cease to beat. Nowhere was
any resistance made; the tyranny was too extensive,
the punishment too swift and universal.</p>

<p class='c000'>The people, drained of blood and money, bowed to the
new power, went to mass, and feebly tried to pick up the
threads of their former occupations.</p>

<p class='c000'>No one came forward to join Louis, and fewer and
more timid became the promises sent to the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>He continued, however, to plan his own expedition as
if all had been so far successful instead of completely
disastrous.</p>

<p class='c000'>The continued campaign of Louis in Friesland was
against his advice; he wished his brother to fall back
on Cleves instead of awaiting Alva's coming.</p>

<p class='c000'>He himself had brought his levies from Cleves to
Strasburg, where he was nearer the central Provinces and
able to retreat into French territory if need were. He
had good hopes from the French Huguenots; he was
still on friendly territory, though far from Dillenburg
and from Louis, whose news reached him slowly, passing
as it did from hand to hand by secret agents across a
country cowering under the Spanish rule. He was also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>on the borders of the Palatinate, and the Elector Palatine
was warmer in the cause of the Netherlands than the
Princes of Hesse or Saxony; the Court of Heidelberg
was indeed the sure refuge for any exiled Protestant,
and the stern Calvinist Frederic was moved by neither
fear of Philip's power nor tolerance towards his faith.</p>

<p class='c000'>But his present encouragement to William was little
more than good wishes, for to him too the Provinces
seemed lost.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was in late July, when William was almost ready
to take the field, that a knight with a few attendants
rode into Strasburg and demanded to see the Prince of
Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had no difficulty in obtaining his wish, for the
German officers recognized him as the Landgrave William,
son of Philip of Hesse and cousin to Anne of Saxony.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found William and Count Hoogstraaten together in an
upper chamber of the modest house where they lodged.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a sultry night and the windows were wide open;
between them sat the Prince at a plain table writing by
the light of a little copper lamp.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was writing to his wife, and the words he penned
as the Landgrave entered were these:‚Äî</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>"I go to-morrow, but when I shall return or when I
shall see you I cannot, on my honour, tell you with
certainty. I have resolved to place myself in the hands
of the Almighty that He may guide me where it is His
good pleasure that I should go. I see well enough that
I am destined to pass this life in misery and labour‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c000'>As he heard the door open, he closed his letter hastily
and put it away.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he rose to greet the Landgrave his eyes shone; he
had a moment's hope that Hesse was sending troops to
his aid, or at least bringing promises of future assistance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Count Hoogstraaten also wore an eager look as he
saluted the German Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>But the appearance of the Landgrave was neither
cheerful nor hopeful; he seated himself heavily, took off
his black silk hat, and wiped his forehead.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is something important," said William quickly, "that
has brought you from Hesse here to seek my poor company."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I came myself," returned the Landgrave, "because
my father could think of no better messenger. I have
been at Dresden, and bear also the messages of the Elector
Augustus."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah!" said William softly.</p>

<p class='c000'>He seated himself and glanced at Hoogstraaten.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Landgrave was a man of blunt words and a stern
courtesy; without preamble he came to what was the
gist of his errand.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Turn back‚Äîwait‚Äîleave the Provinces; it is impossible
to assist them. No one can withstand Alva and his army."</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the sum of what the Landgrave William had
ridden rapidly from Hesse to say.</p>

<p class='c000'>The argument was not new to William, already he
had heard a great deal of such discouragement; but
perhaps it had never before been put to him so weightily
by so important a personage. He listened with his elbow
on the desk and his chin in his hand, his firm, small-featured
profile towards the speaker, his eyes cast down.</p>

<p class='c000'>So plain was he, so modest were his appointments, that
even the unimaginative mind of the Landgrave contrasted
him with the gorgeous bridegroom who had come to
Leipsic for his marriage seven years before.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you not," he exclaimed, "sacrificed enough
already? Are you not sufficiently stripped?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am," answered William, "greatly hampered for
want of money."</p>

<p class='c000'>"How much have you on this enterprise?" asked the
Landgrave.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Everything," said the Prince, "all I and my brothers
and my friends possess."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then you are ruined men!"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>"If we fail, yes," admitted William.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is not possible that you can succeed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is not possible to turn back," replied the Prince,
not arrogantly but rather gently.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You defy the Emperor?" demanded the Landgrave
hotly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have answered the Emperor‚ÄîI have answered King
Philip‚ÄîI have explained myself to all Europe." He exerted
himself to speak pleasantly, but behind the tolerance of his
tone was a certain indignation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Landgrave was baffled and irritated.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are obstinate, Highness, but that will not save
you. What do you hope to do?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"To enter the Netherlands while Louis holds Alva in
check in Friesland."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And if you fail? Can you pay the troops? Have you
a means of retreat?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have not counted the cost so closely," replied William.
"I hope that the great cities will open to me and that I shall
not lack wherewith to pay my troops‚Äîif not, I can but
pledge my word that these debts shall be redeemed when I
can achieve the means."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you ever hope to obtain your estates again?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I hope everything," said William, and he smiled with his
unconquerable cheerfulness, which was like the cheerfulness
of Louis, impervious to all attacks. Gloom, melancholy,
and despondency were unknown to the House of Nassau.
"And yet I expect nothing," he added. "I make neither
boasts nor prophecies, Landgrave; I but take the instruments
to my hand and do what I may with them."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your motive?" cried the other. "Is Your Highness
ambitious or fanatic?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince replied rather wearily‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have proclaimed my motives again and again,
Excellency. I have explained myself at every German
Court, before England, before France‚ÄîI fight Alva and
the Spanish rule over the Netherlands."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>"You fight King Philip," answered the Landgrave,
"though you keep up a fiction of loyalty; and who do you
think will unite with you against Spain, who is half the old
world and all the new?"</p>

<p class='c000'>William smiled again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let him keep his new world and his old, I but want the
Netherlands. Ah, Excellency," he added, "it is in your
power to refuse me help and to turn your back on me‚Äîit
is not in your power to discourage me nor hold me back."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Landgrave rose impatiently with a rough gesture.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are madmen, you and your brothers, and will
meet with the fate of madmen."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince thought of Adolphus, and winced.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It may well be," he said quietly; "believe that we
counted that cost before we undertook our tasks."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is useless to speak any more!" exclaimed the
Landgrave angrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"On this subject, yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince rose and held out his hand affectionately.
"You will stay with us to-night?" he added with courtesy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Landgrave refused.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I go to my lodging; I will come to-morrow to see if
you are in a better frame of mind, Highness."</p>

<p class='c000'>He saluted both, and abruptly left; the Prince returned
to his unfinished letter.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is a strange thing," said Count Hoogstraaten, "how
many are ready to hold a man back, how few to push him
forward! Always these councils of prudence, of caution,
of non-resistance, of humility, and cringing!"</p>

<p class='c000'>And the fiery little soldier went angrily to the window
and stared fiercely out on the hot night; there was something
lion-like in his slender heavy-shouldered figure, in
his blunt-featured face, in his pose of noble anger as he
gazed out on the darkness as if it concealed the numberless
hosts of his foes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince finished his letter and joined his friend in
the window-place.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>"If we live we shall succeed," he said. "If we die as the
others died‚Äîwell, a worse thing might befall us. And what
does submission ever gain? Better to fall like Adolphus
than like‚ÄîEgmont."</p>

<p class='c000'>His voice saddened on his friend's name and his eyes too
turned towards the darkness as if he also pictured there the
swarming battalions of his mighty enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have had our pleasant times, Hoogstraaten,"
he added; "our gay morning was fair and easy, and now we
are men and must take the labour and heat of the day‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>He stopped abruptly; his quick ear had caught the
sound of an opening door. It was the Seigneur de Louverwal
who entered; he carried dispatches which had, he said,
been forwarded to one Van Baren‚Äîan agent of the Prince
in Brussels‚Äîand by him to Strasburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>The letters were from Count Louis and the agent himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>William's lips tightened, the blood receded from his
dark cheek, and he caught his under lip with his teeth as
he read his brother's letter.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was written from a farmhouse on the German frontier,
and announced the Count's pitiable and utter overthrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Out-man≈ìuvred by Alva, harassed by mutinous troops,
lack of money, and provision, betrayed by his own fiery
impatience, Louis had been driven to the village of Jemmingen
on the Ems, and there his wretched forces had
been wiped out by Alva's splendid army and Alva's cool
skill.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those who had escaped the battle were massacred; the
blood of nearly ten thousand rebels had washed from
Alva's laurels the stain left by the little victory of Heiliger
Lee.</p>

<p class='c000'>William read the letter over twice, then sank into a
chair; he was never sanguine, but he had not been prepared
for such a blow as this. He felt his head reel and
his heart beat fast; the light of the little lamp grew dim
before his eyes and the room dark. It was with an unsteady
hand that he handed the letter to Hoogstraaten.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>So the third of the armies he had got together with such
infinite pains and toil and sacrifice had disappeared before
Alva like chaff before a bright flame.</p>

<p class='c000'>De Cocqueville in Artois, De Villars in Juliers, Louis at
Jemmingen‚Äîall defeated, utterly, completely, for ever.</p>

<p class='c000'>A passionate exclamation broke from Hoogstraaten as
he and De Louverwal read the dispatch; it roused William,
who took up the agent's letter and read it slowly.</p>

<p class='c000'>This contained fuller details of the disaster brought by a
Spanish soldier to Maestricht, where Van Baren had been.</p>

<p class='c000'>He now wrote to the Prince that only a handful of the
rebels had escaped, and that they, with Count Louis, had
swum the Ems and fled into Germany. He wrote of the
ghastly butchery which had followed the victory, how
all the dikes and swamps were red, and the sky red also
with burning crops and houses, for Alva had laid waste
Friesland from end to end, sparing neither woman nor
child.</p>

<p class='c000'>And against this background of horrors stood out the
desperate heroism of Louis who had dashed again and
again among his reluctant troops, who had hurled himself
single-handed on the enemy, who had, when the gunners
had fled, fired his only artillery‚Äîthe Groningen cannon,
the poor spoils of Heiliger Lee‚Äîwith his own hand, going
from one to the other with the firebrand; and that
desperate volley had been the last volley of the rebels.</p>

<p class='c000'>When William read of his brother's piteous and splendid
attempts to turn back the dark tides of disaster, when he
read of the slaying and burning of his little army ("the
dead were so thick they choked the river"), he rose with
a movement of intolerable agony, and a sharp sound unconsciously
escaped him‚Äîthe cry of one swiftly and unexpectedly
wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>"O Christ! O, Christ!" muttered Hoogstraaten, and he
looked about him bewildered. "Who will give us levies
now? How shall we do anything?"</p>

<p class='c000'>De Louverwal turned his face away and wept.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>The Prince still said nothing; he loosened his falling
collar and wiped his face and neck bathed in cold sweat;
he put his hand to his throat, and his lips parted as
if he stifled; then he closed his mouth firmly and continued
to pass the handkerchief over his face.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the same unconscious gesture of mental agony that
Lamoral Egmont had used on the scaffold.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, Highness," cried Hoogstraaten‚Äî"ah, Highness,
what news is this?" and his voice was hoarse with love
and pity and wrath.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Eh?" said the Prince faintly. "Eh?"</p>

<p class='c000'>He turned to face his friend, and looked at him a moment
almost blankly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he spoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We must go on‚Äîthere is the more need that we go on."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is it possible?" broke from De Louverwal.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Before God, it is very possible," answered William,
and his voice was suddenly strong.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had now recovered complete mastery of himself; he
sat down and wrote a letter of consolation and encouragement
to Louis.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VII<br /> THE ACTION ON THE GETA</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>The Duke of Alva marched back triumphantly from
Groningen, celebrated the overthrow of Louis of
Nassau with arrogant and hollow rejoicings in the
overawed capital, tortured and beheaded several persons
of distinction‚Äîincluding the brilliant and loyal Burgomaster
of Antwerp, Anthony van Straaten‚Äîand offered
up hundreds of lesser victims as thank-offerings on the
altar of his success, and melted the famous Groningen
cannon to cast a statue of himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile William of Orange, by tireless exertions,
indomitable patience, courage, and enthusiasm, and by
superhuman straining of every nerve to raise the money,
had assembled an army of thirty thousand men, and
exercising his right as a sovereign Prince he declared
war on the Duke of Alva, issued a proclamation of his
motives to the Netherlands, and marched toward the
frontier of Brabant, near Maestricht, where Alva was
encamped.</p>

<p class='c000'>He wished to hazard everything on one great battle
where he might wipe out the disasters of Dalem, Artois,
and Jemmingen, encourage his soldiers, and hearten the
Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Alva would not give battle; his cold and cruel
genius saw that his advantage lay in delay, that William
had not the money to keep his army together long, and
that the German mercenaries, unpaid and inactive, would
soon mutiny and desert.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>William saw this too, but it was impossible for him to
entice the wily Spaniard into an engagement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile the main difficulty remained the money;
every thaler the Nassau family could raise had gone on
the three lost armies and on equipping the present one
for the field. In his proclamation he had said with a
touching courage and cheerfulness, "We have now an
excellent army of cavalry, artillery, and infantry raised
all at our own expense," but this 'excellent army'
could not be kept together without pay or plunder, and
the generous hand that had supplied them was now empty.</p>

<p class='c000'>William appealed to the Netherlander whom he was
coming to rescue, but the three previous defeats had
disheartened utterly the miserable populace, and it was
but a wretched sum that the Prince received; three
hundred thousand crowns had been promised to his agent,
Marcus Pery, and but ten thousand reached the camp.
Applications to the gentlemen who had signed Brederode's
famous Compromise brought no results; and wherever
the Prince's army moved the people fell away from his
line of march, not daring to lift a hand in his service.</p>

<p class='c000'>Well might one of the devices which showed on his
banners be that of a pelican in her piety feeding her
young with her own blood, for it was from themselves
alone the Nassau Princes received support.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Prince mustered his army in Tr√™ves, he had
with him the dauntless Louis, the young Henry, and
Hoogstraaten, and he was soon joined by Lumey, Count
de la Marck, at the head of a ferocious band of followers.
This nobleman, reckless, rough, and daring was a blood
kinsman of Lamoral Egmont, and had joined William
out of motives of personal hate and revenge against Alva.</p>

<p class='c000'>At St. Feit the Prince crossed the Rhine, then by a
bold and brilliant movement his army swam the Meuse
(to Alva's incredulous rage), and marched into Brabant
with all the pomp of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly thirty times he changed his camp on the plains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>of Brabant, each time hoping to lure the Duke into an
engagement; each time Alva, though for ever hanging
on the skirts of the rebels, managed, with consummate
skill, to refuse an action.</p>

<p class='c000'>So passed the weary days of autumn; by the middle
of October the Prince was at St. Trond, intending to
effect a junction with a body of French Huguenots under
De Genlis who were waiting at Waveren.</p>

<p class='c000'>As always Alva was at the Prince's heels, skirmishing
incessantly with the outposts, but always withdrawing
his main army when William advanced for an engagement.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This will end soon, one way or another," said the
Prince. "Either we have a general action, or all is lost
for this campaign."</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke in his tent at St. Trond to Louis and
Hoogstraaten; outside were the camp noises and the
slash of an autumn shower against the canvas.</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis, almost ill with the irritation and fury of being
constantly out-man≈ìuvred, of seeing the army slip from
them while Alva quietly waited, half-crazed with the
thought of his own powerlessness to avert the miserable
failure of the campaign, made no answer, and Hoogstraaten
could only gnash his teeth.</p>

<p class='c000'>But William remained patient; perhaps he had not
expected any more glorious results from this desperate
venture.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quietly he stated the position.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is impossible to pay the men another penny, or
even to feed them much longer. I heard to-day that
Alva has dismantled all the mills in this district. There
will, of course, be a mutiny‚Äîit is quite impossible to keep
them together beyond November, which they take as the
beginning of the winter."</p>

<p class='c000'>"There must be an action!" cried Louis passionately.
"There must be, if I ride into Alva's camp and challenge
him to his face!"</p>

<p class='c000'>And the Count shook with rage at the thought of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>army, got together with such infinite sacrifices, being
miserably disbanded.</p>

<p class='c000'>But his impatience did not help, William would have
reminded him of the results of his fiery recklessness at
Jemmingen.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Alva will never be enticed into an action," said Hoogstraaten,
"he is as cold as this!" and he struck the steel
hilt of his sword. "He is not Aremberg to be fired by his
officers into an imprudence; he is a great general, though a
cruel animal. God curse him."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I salute his generalship," said William, with a bitter
smile. "I admit he has defeated my hopes. One victory‚Äîone
doubtful victory‚Äîand every city in the Netherlands
would have opened to me, all over the country the people
would have risen, for he rules by terror only. Now no
one dares move‚Äîall silent, trembling‚Äîand I helpless,"
he added, with sudden passion, "my God, helpless!"</p>

<p class='c000'>The exclamation was like a passionate prayer. William,
young, ardent, full of courage and energy, felt that word
"helpless" the most terrible of all.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he instantly recovered himself with that mental
strength that made all things possible to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I must meet De Genlis, his reinforcements may be
strong, he may have brought money," he said, then added
with his unfailing thoughtful generosity, "Besides he
has made his way through the Ardennes to meet me, and
I cannot fail him."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Alva might attack as we cross the Geta," said Louis
hopefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is possible‚Äîit might be done," answered the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is too cautious," said Hoogstraaten; "nothing will
tempt him."</p>

<p class='c000'>William rose, went to the entrance of the tent, and lifted
the flap that concealed the October night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rain was now over and the moon had risen large
and yellow, showing the encampment and the motionless
lines of the ruined windmill that crowned the high hill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>opposite. Behind this hill flowed the Geta on the opposite
bank of which Count de Genlis waited for William.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond, where the dark clouds lay heavy on the horizon,
was Alva, like a crouching beast, following his prey cautiously
and waiting for it to fall exhausted ere he sprang.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince's face hardened as he gazed at the ominous
darkness faintly sprinkled with the Spanish camp fires;
he thought of Egmont and Hoorne, Brederode, and Berghen‚Äîof
Adolphus, and his own stolen son, his own insulted
name, his own confiscated property; and against Philip
and Philip's red right hand‚Äîthe hard old man crouching
there with his talons deep in the flesh of the Netherlands‚Äîhis
whole soul went out in wrath and defiance and a
hatred that was like a sensation of triumph and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, old man," he thought passionately, "I am
loved here as you are hated‚Äîand some day that will
tell."</p>

<p class='c000'>He was joined by Hoogstraaten and Count Louis; all
three were almost without hope; all were living, and had
long been living, a life of hardship, privation, and peril; all
of them faced a prospect of either violent death or utter
beggary and exile, yet their mutual youth, courage, and
energy communicated to each other, together with the
sense of love and comradeship, made them almost joyful.</p>

<p class='c000'>They began discussing plans for the crossing of the Geta
to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>A force was to be stationed on the hill, which rose now
blackly against the moonlit sky, to protect the crossing of
the main body of the troops, while the rearguard under
Hoogstraaten was to remain on the bank in a desperate
attempt to lure Alva.</p>

<p class='c000'>In case this was successful and the Spaniard advanced
his main army, William and Louis were to recross the Geta
and engage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The plan was desperate, and William could hardly place
much reliance on it, but Hoogstraaten was exultant at
the chance of coming to grips with the enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>Louis felt some vexation that the command of the rearguard
had not been given to him; the truth was William
relied more on Hoogstraaten's coolness than Louis'
audacity in this perilous and delicate position.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have Jemmingen against me!" said Louis, with
a laugh, and he pulled at his orange sash with strong
impatient fingers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Confess, Count," cried Hoogstraaten gaily, "that
your retreat then was unnecessary and that Alva does not
deserve to be so feared! Here we have been several days
in the Netherlands and we have seen nothing of the
Spaniards but their backs!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"And when you see their faces," replied Louis, vexed,
"I warrant you will remember it for the rest of your
life."</p>

<p class='c000'>Hoogstraaten caught his arm and begged his forgiveness
for the rough jest.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, jest while you can," said Louis, instantly smiling
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A light heart never hurt any cause," said William.</p>

<p class='c000'>He dropped the tent flap and called his page; bidding
the boy give him his sword, his mantle, and his hat, and
to have his horse brought, he prepared to make a tour
of his forces and see all was in readiness for the morrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Count Louis and Hoogstraaten departed on the
same business to their several commands; first all three
embraced warmly, and, in case they should not meet
again before the bustle and confusion of the morning,
William gave Hoogstraaten some parting words of encouragement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Despite their terrible anxieties and the agonizing
difficulties of their position, the three commanders were
now cheerful, almost gay.</p>

<p class='c000'>The night was beautiful, warm, lit by the mellow light
of the harvest moon and fragrant with the smell of the
earth recently moistened by the rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince's men, as if encouraged by the decisive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>action promised for the morrow, were also quiet and
seemed cheerful; a few days before there had been a fierce
mutiny, when the Prince's sword had been shot from his
side, but now all was tranquil, and William was loyally
received as he went on his rounds.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the refugee Netherlander were gathered together
in an open space between the tents listening to the
words of a Calvinist minister; little groups of others,
scattered here and there, sang psalms softly to themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>The German mercenaries were engaged in mending their
clothes, in cooking their supper, or in playing dice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The keen smell of coarse hot soup, the strong scent
of the picketed horses mingled on the fresh air; the light
of the lanterns at the tent entrances and the small fires
feebly rising after the shower shone on pots and pans,
pieces of polished or rusty armour, bundles of kindling
sticks covered with autumn leaves, and baskets of apples
and pears, golden-red.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here and there the windows of the little farmhouses
and cottages where the officers were quartered glowed
with a bright light.</p>

<p class='c000'>William, riding with his little band of officers from one
battalion to another, dreamt of a victory, of turning back
Alva's troops, of breaking his prestige, of a whole country
throwing off with groans of relief the loathed Spanish
chains and welcoming her deliverers.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had no grounds for such dreams but the sense of
life and strength in his own body, in the fine horse beneath
him, in the exaltation he received in gazing at the noble
cloudy spaces of the sky, and the great moon that had
shone on so many battles, and in the dark outlines of the
hills and horizons of the hidden country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was he disheartened by the sight of the surgeon
with his mule and cases going from tent to tent, nor by
that of a cartful of dead men whose limbs fell limp as rags
and whose bodies were defaced with gunshot; near these
victims of a little skirmish was a tent of men, ill of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>malarious fever, the sharp delirious voices of some came
out on to the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince continued on horseback till the dawn, when
he returned to his tent to arm, and the army moved into
battle array.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun rose strong and clear though with the mellow
radiance of the Low Countries and the autumn; all that
had been obscured by the dead light of the moon was now
distinct: the scars and rags of the soldiers, the brilliant
scarves of the officers, the disorder and dirt of the camp,
the broken sails of the tall thatched windmill, the dried
autumn grass on the little hill, the low waters of the Geta
sparkling a sluggish gold.</p>

<p class='c000'>Still all seemed hopeful, cheerful, full of presages of
good fortune.</p>

<p class='c000'>Birds were singing in the trees growing in the farm
gardens, a few poppies and daisies blew on the hillsides,
the sun was warm as summer but the air fresh with the
coolness of the turn of the year.</p>

<p class='c000'>William rode with his troops to the banks of the Geta,
and sent them across in good order and safety, battalion
after battalion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Spanish, whose outposts were near enough to
observe these movements, made no sign of action.</p>

<p class='c000'>Meanwhile, Hoogstraaten remained behind on the bank
with three thousand men, while the Seigneur de Louverwal
and a detachment of cavalry occupied the hill.</p>

<p class='c000'>Steadily and successfully the Prince's army forded the
river, regiment after regiment passing undisturbed, the
infantry on the cruppers of the horsemen or wading at
their stirrups. Again and again William glanced at the
little hill where the patriotic banners of Hoogstraaten
waved.</p>

<p class='c000'>About noon the Spanish attacked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Don Frederic, the Prior of St. John, brought up seven
thousand troops and threw himself against the Netherlanders.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>All was obscured in the lilac-coloured smoke of cannon
and musket shot with flames; William could no longer see
his banners nor the gallant lines of Hoogstraaten's men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Spanish did not cross the river, as the three leaders
had so desperately hoped, nor could William return, as the
further bank was now lined by Alva's cannon.</p>

<p class='c000'>No news came from the fierce conflict surging to and fro
by the waters of the Geta, but towards evening the foul
smoke cleared, and the Spanish flag was visible floating from
the shot-riddled windmill.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little later a few soldiers escaped across the river,
bringing to the Prince news that the entire rearguard had
been cut to pieces, that Louverwal was a prisoner, and that
the survivors of the awful day were now being massacred
by Don Frederic's men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another miserable handful brought with them Hoogstraaten,
unconscious, fastened to his horse by the reins,
and with a shattered foot.</p>

<p class='c000'>AU that night the moonlight was dimmed by the fires
that burnt along the Geta.</p>

<p class='c000'>These flames came from the farmhouses where Hoogstraaten's
men had taken a despairing refuge. Don Frederic
had at once ordered these buildings to be set alight, and
those maddened wretches who hurled themselves from
the flames found themselves impaled on the spears of the
Spanish waiting without.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nobler spirits put an end to their own lives to
escape the taunts of their enemies; all alike disappeared
in the same funeral pyres, the high-mounting flames of
which illuminated the fierce faces of the victorious army
and the stately figure of the militant priest who commanded
them, and cast a red glow of blood and fire on
those two triumphant symbols‚Äîthe arms of the King of
Spain, the cross of the Romish Church.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> THE ANABAPTIST PREACHER</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>A few days after this fourth disaster the Prince
joined the Huguenots at Waveren.</p>

<p class='c000'>These allies, late as they were, might have proved
of some material assistance, for they consisted of three
thousand foot and three hundred horse‚Äîall eager Protestants,
not hired mercenaries, but as soon as he rode into the
French camp the Prince saw that he was face to face with
another disappointment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The little force of Count de Genlis was so hampered with
women and children, aged folk and infirm, that it was likely
to prove rather a burden than a relief to the over-taxed
resources of the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Huguenots indeed rather seemed a band of refugees
escaping from destruction themselves than an army
marching to the rescue of persecuted brethren.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even De Genlis, the high-spirited and gallant French
commander, could not advise William to try another engagement
in the Netherlands, though they were within a
few leagues of Brussels and of Louraine.</p>

<p class='c000'>And William was as helpless as if his hands and feet were
tied. He could neither pay his men, nor feed them; every
day some deserted. Alva's masterly tactics had succeeded;
the Prince's army was dispersing without having accomplished
anything but the ruin of their commander, for
William was personally pledged for the payment of the
troops, and he had neither property nor credit with which
to redeem his word.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>He had staked heavily and lost heavily, and now stood
stripped and beggared before the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his camp at Waveren he faced his position which he
saw clearly for all his cheerfulness; he admitted that Alva
had out-generaled him, but not in that was his bitterest
disappointment, but in the silence of the Netherlands.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had believed that the people would rise to welcome
him; he had hoped that some cities would open their gates
to him, he had been confident that the nobles and merchants
would assist him with money.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had not sufficiently reckoned on the strength of
terror which Alva had inspired, nor on the awful condition
of the unfortunate Netherlanders.</p>

<p class='c000'>He who had always been used to princely dealings, to
use generosity and lavishness to all, was now bitterly
humiliated and galled by his inability to redeem his solemn
promise; and that to him was the bitterest part of his
universal failure. Alva's triumph, the disappointment of
his friends, his own lost prestige, and disgrace, his own
personal beggary‚Äîthese things did not move him as did
the thought of the weary mutinous soldiers whom he could
not pay, nor, as far as he could see, would be ever able
to pay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Winter was approaching, the land was as barren, the
weather as chill, as the prospects of William of Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he sat in his tent this late October evening he felt
the cold wind creep under the canvas and penetrate his
mantle so that he shivered. His camp furniture was
in some disorder, and half the large tent was curtained off
by a handsome purple hanging.</p>

<p class='c000'>Behind this lay Count Hoogstraaten. William had
ordered him to be removed into his own tent, because
neither he nor any man would long have the company
of Hoogstraaten now.</p>

<p class='c000'>The surgeon came from this inner apartment and said
the Count slept.</p>

<p class='c000'>William's eyes looked a question.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>"When he wakes?" said the surgeon. "I fear, Your
Highness, that when he wakes it will be but a waking to
death."</p>

<p class='c000'>He bowed and took his leave; he had many cases in the
camp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince turned his gaze towards the purple curtains
and leant back heavily in his chair. It seemed as if all his
friends, all who loved him, trusted him, served him, were to
be taken from him, involved in the common misfortune
he had brought on them.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed ironical, a needless cruelty, that the brave,
generous, and gay Hoogstraaten should die.</p>

<p class='c000'>His wound had been caused by the chance discharge
of his own pistol, and at first had not seemed dangerous,
but he had sunk into weakness and fever, a sickness
perhaps as much of a despairing mind as of a wounded
body, and now he lay slipping into death.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been an added torture to William to listen to the
sick man's delirium‚Äîall on the theme of the dissolving
army, the fruitless campaign, the liabilities of the commanders,
the useless slaughter on the Geta, for which
the poor Count held himself responsible.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Supplies, supplies, if we could but get supplies, if we
could but keep the men together!" had been the burden
of the dying soldier's delirium, and William passionately
wished that some good news might come if only to allow
Hoogstraaten to die in peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>But no good news did come; rather was misfortune
heaped on misfortune.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince held now in his hand letters from Dillenburg
received a few days ago; Count John wrote with the
gallant Nassau cheerfulness, but could not disguise that
he sent evil tidings.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anne of Saxony had seized the moment of her husband's
ruin to forsake him; despite the letters of the Prince, the
expostulations of her German kinsfolk and the Nassau
women, Anne had flung herself free of all loyalty, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>broken the bonds which had so long been hateful. She
had written to Alva, throwing herself on his mercy and
declaring she was a widow in the eyes of the law, as her
husband was a prescribed exile with no civil rights, and entreating
the Duke to return her her dowry out of William's
confiscated property.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, abandoning her daughter and her baby son, she
had fled from Dillenburg to Cologne and there set up a
household of her own, surrounded by the exiles and refugees
that crowded the city.</p>

<p class='c000'>The news had not much power to hurt William's heart,
his wife had been so long, even from the first, indifferent
to him, and he could despise her disloyalty; but it was
another blow to his pride, his dignity, the completion of
his ruin, another cause for his enemies to laugh at him.
"Madame your wife," had always been one of the objects
of Granvelle's keen sneers, and the Cardinal, watching
events from Rome, would sneer indeed now, as he would
sneer at the army so painfully collected, so miserably
dispersed, at the Prince who had defied the King of Spain
and been beaten from his country's frontiers, a beggared
exile.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not in William's nature to feel wrathful towards
the woman who had so struck him, his sentiment now
was a vast indifference, as if she had never existed, or only
existed as some shadow from whom he was at last for
ever free.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he sat there in a loneliness only peopled by bitter and
sad reflections and the spectres of ruin, failure, and despair,
two of the officers attached to his person entered the tent.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince looked up sharply, as if bracing himself to
hear further disaster.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the officers came with news of trifling importance:
A fellow, evidently a Netherlander, had made his way
into the camp last night and had entreated most earnestly
for an audience of the Prince, and had gone from one
officer to another with such importunate eagerness, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>at length they had been moved to prefer his request to
the General himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>William had always been easy of access in the days of
his prosperity, and it was not in him to surround himself
with state in this time of his misfortune and overthrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled faintly, drawing his brows together as he did
when perplexed or amused.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let him come here," he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the officers suggested that perhaps the fellow was
one of Alva's spies or assassins.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, that!" exclaimed William wearily.</p>

<p class='c000'>Death was the least of the terrors with which he had to
contend; he knew that probably Alva schemed to murder
him, and it left him as indifferent as did the thought of
Anne's treachery.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the officers left him he retired so completely
into his own thoughts again that he forgot the incident,
and it was with a slight start that he looked up to see
a stranger, escorted by two soldiers, standing before the
tent entrance.</p>

<p class='c000'>This man stood very humbly bowing, as if too overcome
by some emotion to speak, and William, interested in him,
bade him enter, and dismissed the soldiers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stranger was of middle life with the appearance of
humble birth and poor means; his clothes, though exquisitely
neat, were shabby and thin; his features were
pinched with cold, and maybe privation.</p>

<p class='c000'>He stood crushing his hat to his breast and gazing at the
Prince with an expression of utter confusion and awe.</p>

<p class='c000'>William addressed him in Flemish, kindly asking him
his errand.</p>

<p class='c000'>The other continued to gaze at him with that look of
wonder and reverence that was embarrassed but not at all
stupid, rather a kind of amaze, as if he could not credit that
this slim young man, with the pale dark face, wrapped in
the plain blue mantle could be the great Prince of Orange.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is His Highness?" he asked timidly.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>"I am William of Orange," answered the Prince, and
as he spoke he felt that it was the name of the most unfortunate
of men.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the man seemed to need further encouragement,
William added, "It was he you wished to see?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have come all the way from Holland to see Your
Highness," was the simple reply.</p>

<p class='c000'>"From Holland? Alone?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, Your Highness. It is a long way, and the Duke
of Alva's army was often in my way‚Äîotherwise I would
have been with Your Highness sooner," he added, in a tone
of deprecating apology.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince looked keenly at the quiet-looking individual
who had undertaken with such simplicity a journey which
meant risking his life a thousand times.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who are you, my friend?" he asked gently.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man raised his eyes which under this gaze he had
kept abased, and William was instantly conscious of a
resolute and fearless spirit looking out of the plain insignificant
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am an Anabaptist preacher, Your Highness; I have
a little congregation of poor outcasts in Holland‚Äîwe
mostly live in hiding, and meet secretly to worship. There
are not so many of us as there were, for the persecutions
have been very fierce and we are quite defenceless.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A little while ago a gentleman of Haarlem smuggled
into the town a copy of Your Highness's most noble proclamation,
and it came into my hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That day I knelt to bless God for having raised up such
a Prince, and when my poor people met together again
I read them the joyful news, and told them that Your
Highness appealed for money to support your army,
whereat we, with a good heart, put together what we
could, and as I was the only one who had no one dependent
on me and knew the country well, I was elected to carry
this small offering to Your Highness."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince was too overwhelmed to speak; his quick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>mind, his warm heart, pictured the whole incident: The
hunted outcast Protestants reading his paper, their eager
gratitude and hopes, the secret putting together of what
they could pinch from their poverty, the setting forth
of the pastor, the perils and anxieties of his journey with
his precious burden, his self-denial and hardship rather
than touch his treasure, the modest unconsciousness
with which he made his little speech‚Äîall this William
saw vividly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness in your paper speaks of repayment,"
continued the Anabaptist, "but we require no payment,
only kindness when Your Highness shall be triumphant."</p>

<p class='c000'>Cautiously he took from the wallet at his side a small
canvas bag, and, gazing at it with a look of relief and a
touch of pride, laid it on the little table beside the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>With a movement almost mechanical William untied the
strings and looked at the contents.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were about a hundred crowns in gold and some
silver‚Äîthis last what the pastor had saved on his journey
by sleeping in ditches and almost starving.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is very little," said the Anabaptist nervously,
oppressed by the silence of the Prince; "the will is better
than the gift."</p>

<p class='c000'>William remained motionless, staring at the pitiful
little bag of money which represented such a spirit of
sacrifice, such an enthusiasm still existent in the country
he had deemed supine and crushed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I thank you," he faltered, "indeed‚ÄîI‚Äîthank
you‚Äî‚Äî" A hundred crowns! and one month's wage of
his army was some hundreds of thousands of crowns. A
hundred crowns! A few years ago he had flung away as
much on a pair of gauntlets‚Äîa dog‚Äîa toy; the smallness
of the gift moved the Prince almost beyond bearing. He
held out his hand towards the Anabaptist, and he, who
had endured the loss of his brother, his friends, his wife,
his army, his fortune, with fortitude, now broke down
before this humble sympathy.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Putting his other hand before his eyes, he wept.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Highness will receive more," stammered the
pastor. "There are other Protestant congregations who
are collecting for you‚Äîeven if the big towns do not open,
you have entered the hearts of the Netherlanders."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince's shoulders heaved; he raised his face,
flushed and quivering with tears.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I thank you," he repeated, in a firm voice. "I thank
you from my heart‚Äîyou see me weak, but you must not
notice it‚ÄîI have not slept well of late. I will give you
my receipt for this money and you must thank your
people for me, and tell them I will repay them as soon as
I can repay any of my debts‚Äîand for yourself take this,
in remembrance of me," he drew from his finger a little
yellow intaglio seal ring‚Äîone of the few personal jewels
left him‚Äîand put it on the thin finger of the Anabaptist
who bent before him in speechless gratitude and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Promising to see him again before his departure, the
Prince was sending away the preacher in the custody of
his page, that the poor traveller might enjoy the best
hospitality the camp could afford, when the Anabaptist
turned and asked with a timid earnestness, "Are the
faith of Your Highness and that faith you come to protect,
the same?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"My faith?" repeated William.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Forgive me, but it is not commonly known if you
follow the true religion."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I follow what I believe to be true," said the Prince.
"Otherwise I could not go on. For the rest, I am no
Romanist." He paused a moment, then added with a
little smile, "If any of your people ask after me, tell them
that I too am an outcast and an exile‚Äîthat I, too, am
a heretic. Say, too, that I am not discouraged, that if
I fail now I shall endeavour to try again. Ask them to
be courageous and to give me their prayers."</p>

<p class='c000'>When he was alone again he lifted the curtains and
went to Count Hoogstraaten's bedside.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>The gallant little soldier lay propped on pillows and
covered with rugs; the dim light of a shaded lamp fell
on the bold young face which, in the last few days, had
changed so terribly, and over which the shadow of death
now rested.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was tossing in a restless sleep; William went on
his knees beside him and put his cool hand on the hot
forehead dewed with beads of pain and exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Count lay quiet awhile, then opened his eyes; he
recognized the Prince immediately, and at once his dry
lips began to murmur the words that were the expression
of the mental agony that was killing him‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Any news? Any supplies? Any money raised?
Any means of keeping the men together?"</p>

<p class='c000'>William firmly clasped the feverish hand that lay outside
the coverlet.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Help has come," he answered; "but now I have left
a man who brought me supplies from Holland‚Äîand there
are other promises of assistance."</p>

<p class='c000'>A light came into the dying man's eyes. His tense
body relaxed with a shiver of relief.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then‚Äîthen you will be able to carry on the campaign?"
he said faintly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"With God's help I shall go on," answered the Prince
gravely.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Supplies, you say‚Äîfrom Holland?" murmured Hoogstraaten.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Just brought into the camp‚Äîin gold," said William,
"and, as I said, there are other promises; many, many
are willing to help us‚Äîthe country begins to move in our
favour."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Count closed his eyes and was silent, but his face
relaxed into a look of content, and William blessed the
hundred crowns of the Anabaptist that had served
to soothe the bitterness of failure and death for his
friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a while they remained thus, the Prince kneeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>and holding the tired right hand that had been unfailing
in his service, the Count with his face pressed to the pillow
and his eyes closed.</p>

<p class='c000'>William thought of the tumultuous days in Antwerp
when Hoogstraaten, and he only, had stood faithfully
and bravely by his side‚Äîthought of all the long, loyal,
sincere friendship that went back to the old gay times of
feast and joust, hawking and hunting‚Äîthe times when
neither Anthony de Lalaing nor he had ever dreamt of
such an hour as this. He thought, too, of the Countess
at Dillenburg‚Äîwaiting‚Äîalready in mourning for one
brother dead, and one doomed to die‚Äîwaiting for the
news‚Äîthe news which would be that of a third bereavement;
he thought of Anne at Cologne, cringing before
Alva, and wondered if she would not be glad if her husband,
that great heretic and rebel, was dead too.</p>

<p class='c000'>Towards midnight the sick man spoke again, recommending
his poor wife‚Äîhe said twice, with a great sigh,
"My poor wife!"‚Äîto the Prince, and begging him help,
should occasion offer, his child, for the Count was beggared
in the cause for which he died, and the Montmorencys,
his wife's people, were more than beggared.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not to be a burden to you," he insisted in his weak,
hoarse voice, "but‚Äîwhat you can‚Äîif Hoorne had been
here‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>William promised, and the Count carried the Prince's
hand to his heart and held it there.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was now so clearly failing that Louis and other
officers came to say farewell; he was still a Romanist,
but there was no priest in the camp. A Lutheran minister
brought him what comfort he could.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is no matter," said Hoogstraaten, who was now past
formulas. "God must judge of me‚Äîinto Thy hands‚Äîinto
Thy hands‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the dawn he died, and the party he had espoused
was the poorer for his loss, and the Prince a lonelier
man.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>"I am glad you have the supplies," were his last words,
spoken so low that none but William, who held his head
on his breast, could hear. "I am glad that gold came
from Holland."</p>

<p class='c000'>William, too, was glad for many reasons.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX<br /> WINTER TIME</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>The castle of Dillenburg was now a house of mourning,
the Countess of Hoogstraaten now wore black
also; all the women went softly, talking in
whispers, and shuddering when a messenger rode into the
courtyard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Count John was desperately employed in raising money
for the Prince; a further mortgage was put on such lands
as they still could control, further portions of the Prince's
possessions‚Äîthose few he had retained for himself were
sold; his chapel furniture was melted to obtain the gold
and silver it contained, he had himself sold by auction all
his camp equipment‚Äîeven his horses, his weapons, his
armour‚Äîleaving himself with one mount, one sword, one
suit of mail like any poor trooper.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had sent orders that his remaining household should
be dismissed. Some had gone with Anne to Cologne;
others, scenting ruin, had already dispersed; the remainder
left, now returning to their homes or seeking other employment.
The Prince, who had been the most richly
attended of any man in the Netherlands, had now not one
servant; and he, the splendour of whose garments had
been one of the glories of the capital, now wrote to his
brother to send him "Two more pair of hose‚Äîthe mended
silk ones in my cabinet and those under repair at the tailor";
he who had always been regally magnificent in his gifts,
now besought John to "find a good grey horse, which
might be paid for by one of the silver ornaments still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>remaining in my cabinet, or a piece of the chapel service,"
with which to reward one of his faithful agents.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had tried to persuade his troops to take service with
the French Huguenots, but they had refused, and demanded
to be led back to Germany; he was accordingly
at Strasburg, where he disbanded this army on which so
many gallant hopes had been set, and which had ruined
him so utterly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The gloom deepened over Dillenburg, even John,
usually so resolute and cheerful, appeared sombre; he
too was almost ruined; his fortune and his children's
heritage had largely vanished in this fruitless and fatal
campaign; he saw himself burdened with debts and
liabilities which it was scarcely possible he could ever
repay.</p>

<p class='c000'>The women cried in secret, but were outwardly serene,
and Juliana of Stolberg wrote encouraging letters to the
Prince and to Louis, and her dreads and terrors only showed
for an instant in the words with which she besought them
to have a care of Henry and not needlessly risk his young
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this household R√©n√®e le Meung still lingered, supported
by the kindness of the Countess of Nassau and her
daughters in what was the blackest period of her sad life.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the flight of Anne she saw her own failure, the collapse
of her own long years of patient labour‚Äîall had been
useless. Anne had fulfilled her destiny, and the waiting-woman
was left without occupation and without any object
in life‚Äîbehind her the wasted barren years, before her a
hopeless future.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was as bankrupt as the Prince and as lonely.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was clear she could not remain at Dillenburg; she was
but a burden and an encumbrance in a household beginning
to be run with the strictest economy. Anne had
fiercely refused to take her to Cologne, nor did R√©n√®e wish
to go, for her influence over the Princess had ceased and
Anne was openly defying her husband and her kinsfolk.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>She was living at Cologne surrounded by any rabble she
could find to sympathize with her, and she had put her
legal affairs‚Äîher frantic attempts to recover her property,
and her wild expedients to raise money‚Äîinto the hands of
Jan Rubens, the Brussels' lawyer.</p>

<p class='c000'>R√©n√®e sickened to think of this; her whole spirit was
crushed by the misfortunes which had overwhelmed not
only her country and her faith but all she cared for, and the
little world in which she had moved and served.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no further occupation for her at Dillenburg;
William's children were in charge of his mother and sisters
and of the Landgravine Elisabeth, Count John's wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Court of the Elector Palatine‚Äîthat refuge of all
persecuted Protestants‚Äîoccurred to R√©n√®e; some German
ladies she had known at Dresden were prepared to welcome
her there.</p>

<p class='c000'>She suggested this plan to the Countess of Nassau one
heavy November day when they walked in the castle gardens
to catch the faint chill glimpse of the winter sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You, too, are eager to leave us!" exclaimed the
Countess, who could not forget Anne's fierce denunciations
of the dulness of the life at Dillenburg.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, Madame, no," said R√©n√®e eagerly; "but I
must work‚Äîin some way I must justify my life‚Äîor die."</p>

<p class='c000'>Juliana pressed her hand kindly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I know, my child, I know. There is indeed nothing
but idleness for you here where we women are too many
already."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is terrible to be a woman!" cried R√©n√®e. "Too
many, ah yes, too many!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"But we are not useless," said the Countess gently.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waiting-woman answered with passionate conviction‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Not such women as you with five sons!‚Äîbut women
such as I! I am like a dead leaf before the breeze; if I am
cast away and lost, no one will be the poorer. If I had
been a man, however mean and humble, I could have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>followed‚Äîfollowed," she avoided the Prince's name, "the
Protestant flag‚ÄîI could have at least died. It is not
even permitted to women to die nobly."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Countess looked at her curiously and was silent.
To Juliana also the enclosed life of a woman seemed at
times terrible; there was something awful in this post in
the background, always to be patient, always serving,
always waiting‚Äîworst of all, the waiting.</p>

<p class='c000'>At that moment the fate of the women seemed worse
than that of the men; their piteous figures stood out
mournfully against the red background of the persecutions
and the war: Sabina of Egmont left starving with her
children at the mercy of the man who had slain her husband;
the Dowager Countess of Hoorne, having lost one son on
the scaffold, moving heaven and earth to save the other
from a similar fate; H√©l√®ne, Montigny's wife, widowed
after a four month's marriage, and weeping a husband
enclosed in the hopeless depths of a Spanish prison; the
Countess of Hoogstraaten, ruined, thrice bereaved; the
Countess of Aremberg suddenly widowed; and all those
more obscure women who were orphaned, bereft of husband
and child, spurned from their dismantled homes to beg or
starve.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps it was better to be a man and face a swift death
in the open field.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But we have no choice," said the Countess, with a little
smile that creased her fresh wrinkled face; "we must do
what falls to our lot and not think of the difficulties."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What falls to me?" asked R√©n√®e; "no one wants me,
nor ever has since my mother died. The Princess always
hated me. I made no friends; my home, my family, was
swept away in a ruin that has pursued everything I have
loved or cared for ever since‚Äîmy country, my faith,
my‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>She checked herself suddenly and went pale.</p>

<p class='c000'>"... Your love?" finished the Countess softly.
"Surely you have loved some one?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>R√©n√®e hesitated a moment then answered in a low voice‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, I loved. Some one who is not of my station and
who hardly knows my name nor my face. He‚Äîhe went
to the war, and he, like all, is quite ruined now and quite
desolate. Probably I shall never see him again."</p>

<p class='c000'>She stopped suddenly and faced the Countess, her
warm rich beauty glowing in the grey air against the grey
background of garden wall and castle.</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is my story and my life," she said. "What would
you do with such a life, Madame?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Truly the Countess did not know; her own years had
been so full that she could not picture an empty existence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You cannot understand," added R√©n√®e, "what it is
to mourn the loss of what you never had."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You will love again," said the Countess, whose outlook
was eminently practical and sane, "or at least you will
take a husband, and then your life will be full."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Some women love once only, alas for them!" answered
R√©n√®e, "perhaps it is a foolishness, but one cannot change
one's heart."</p>

<p class='c000'>Then she shrank into herself and was once more enfolded
in reserve deeper than before, as if afraid of having said
too much.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sun had disappeared now, to be seen no more that
day, and dark clouds full of rain or perhaps snow closed
over the sky. The two women returned to the castle, which
was cheerful with the light of great wood fires and pleasant
with the sound of children playing.</p>

<p class='c000'>By the hooded chimney-piece of the dining-room, where
the meal was being already prepared, sat Vanderlinden,
the Elector Augustus' alchemist. He had been sent by
his master, who still placed implicit faith in his charts and
tables, to persuade Count John that further exertions on
the behalf of the Netherlands were useless, and that the
stars plainly indicated that the Prince should return to
Germany and not risk his fortunes further.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was strange to R√©n√®e to see the old man and recall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>how she had last seen him at the brilliant Leipsic wedding,
and to think of all that had gone between, and how that
famous marriage had ended, and yet how, in a circle,
things had come round, and how Augustus was still consulting
the stars and casting horoscopes and charts, and the
alchemist still searching for the Philosopher's Stone and
only a little greyer and more bent than before.</p>

<p class='c000'>His talk was still of his experiments; outside events
had touched him very little, and he took but a slight interest
in the tasks of fortune-telling the Elector, his patron, set
him. His eyes were still fixed on the Great Discovery, the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum opus</span></i>‚Äîeternal gold, eternal youth, eternal health‚Äîand
in the pursuit of this object, for which he had lost both
gold, youth, and health, he was as eager and as sanguine as
he had ever been.</p>

<p class='c000'>He remembered R√©n√®e, and asked if she still had the
charm he had given her; she showed it to him instantly,
her only ornament, hidden in the folds of her cambric vest.</p>

<p class='c000'>She asked the old man if he had heard of Dupr√®s, and
he told her calmly, without surprise, that the skryer, after
escaping from the bloody rout of Jemmingen, had returned
to him at Dresden and begged to be taken into his old
master's service.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They always return at length these restless rascals,"
added Vanderlinden. "And I have taken him back, for
he is clever, and when the mood is on him can raise the
spirits in the crystal."</p>

<p class='c000'>So Dupr√®s' tale had ended in a circle too, and he was
back again at his old employment under his old master;
somehow R√©n√®e was glad that he was not in Cologne.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Countess of Nassau joined the two as they stood
and talked by the fire.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, Magister," she said, "do you still hope to find
the Philosopher's Stone?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not despair at all, Your Excellency," he answered
quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But if there is no such stone?" asked the Countess.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>He smiled as one who cannot restrain his amusement
at the foolishness of the ignorant.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It has been discovered, Madame, many times," he
answered gently.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And always lost again?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"And always lost."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is strange, Magister, that more care was not
taken to preserve such a secret."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, Madame, it is too great a thing to be lightly
imparted from one man to another; it can only be
attained after much labour, much suffering, prayer, and
humiliation."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It would change the world," said R√©n√®e, and she
thought of the Prince and how gold was all the difference
between success and failure. William had failed through
lack of it; for that reason Alva might fail too.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It would be a terrible power," added the Countess
thoughtfully. "Perhaps it is as well that it is not often
discovered."</p>

<p class='c000'>The old man stroked his beard and looked into the fire
silently; he seemed so humble, so serene, so insignificant,
that R√©n√®e wondered why he was so eager for gold and
power. Then she thought that perhaps he cared for neither,
and that he had pitted himself against this secret as
William had pitted himself against Philip, and that in
both it was not the thought of the reward that urged
them on to undertake tasks seemingly impossible, but the
glory of the struggle, the mighty pleasure of overcoming,
the ultimate hope of attainment.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And my sons?" asked Juliana of Stolberg; "what
disastrous prophecies have you made against the House
of Nassau?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Vanderlinden came from his dreams with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They might all be safe if they would be warned," he
said. "Your Excellency heard that an astrologer warned
Count Hoorne not to go to Brussels? And yet he went
and died."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>"A brave man cannot take these warnings," said the
Countess stoutly. "It is not for Princes and leaders to
count the cost of the steps they make, nor to think of their
own lives."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then my charts and tables are useless," replied the
alchemist.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They please the Elector," said Juliana.</p>

<p class='c000'>The alchemist was silent; he knew himself that his
prophecies did little more than amuse his master.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You shall speak to Count John, as the Elector bade
you," resumed the Countess, "but you will not suppose
that any one can turn back the Count nor his brothers
from what they have set their hands to."</p>

<p class='c000'>She spoke with pride and courage, but sorrowfully, as
one who sees clearly and unfalteringly ahead and sees
nothing but grief and trouble.</p>

<p class='c000'>With an unconscious gesture of patience she folded her
hands together and looked at the window against which
big drops of rain were beginning to splash.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her thoughts had returned to her three defeated sons
at Strasburg, as the alchemist's thoughts had returned
to the Elixir of life and wealth. R√©n√®e, standing between
them, felt forgotten by both; she, too, was thinking of
Strasburg and of the man there disbanding his troops in
humiliation and failure.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X<br /> THE ABBESS</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_1 c012'>It was a day in early spring‚Äîspring, yet sharp and
chill with winter‚Äîthat the three penniless and
defeated Nassau Counts rode through France to
offer their swords‚Äîall they had now to offer‚Äîto the
Prince de Cond√© who was upholding the Protestant cause
in France.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eight thousand of their men had been slain during the
campaign, thirty thousand had been disbanded at Strasburg,
and a little handful of cavalry had elected to follow
the fortunes of the three adventurers, for the exiled,
landless, and ruined brothers were now no better in the eyes
of Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>With all their strenuous exertions and the energetic
help of Count John, they had not been able to even half
pay the troops.</p>

<p class='c000'>William had personally undertaken to discharge this debt
from the first money he could command, and solemnly
promised, that if he should return alive from Cond√©'s
army still penniless, he would surrender his person as
hostage for their money.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before he left Germany he endeavoured to come to a
meeting with his wife; but Anne could not or would not
move, and it was without seeing her again that he left his
native country to take service under a foreign flag.</p>

<p class='c000'>Granvelle, snug in Rome, laughed; Alva celebrated in
Brussels an extravagantly arrogant open triumph; Philip
triumphed quietly within his own cold narrow heart.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>So ended the first struggle between William of Orange
and the power of Spain; so, stripped even of fame and
glory, laughed at by his enemies, despaired of by his
friends, did he, who had been one of the greatest and most
magnificent Princes of his time, ride into exile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet neither William nor his brothers were gloomy;
there was a music in their souls, a fire in their blood, that
ever kept them from melancholy; even when they spoke
of Adolphus or Hoogstraaten, it was with an affectionate
smile, almost gaily, as they knew these dead would have
wished them to speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>Skirting Switzerland the little company passed into
Franche Comt√©, and one of their first halting-places was
near Besan√ßon.</p>

<p class='c000'>The morning after they had pitched their tents William
was riding slowly through the fields which were beginning
to be faintly coloured with the first trembling spring
flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little thicket of hawthorn concealed the high road,
and beyond the meadows woods sloped over undulating
valleys and gently rising hills; numberless birds were
singing in the little copse, and the sky was a delicate azure
veiled with milk-white clouds; it was the first day of
real spring, of the awakening of the earth, of the return
of the promise of life, increase, and abundance.</p>

<p class='c000'>William had not been long alone in his musing progress
through the fields when he was joined by Count Henry.</p>

<p class='c000'>This youth, in his green vesture, his little helmet with
the long, single heron's feather, with his gay carriage, his
handsome face and eager expression, was as bright as the
morning, as pleasant as the early spring.</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke to his brother with a little laugh, as if greatly
amused.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is a party of travellers who are afraid of us!
They have sent a messenger to know if they may safely
pass along the road where we are encamped."</p>

<p class='c000'>William, too, smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>"Give them all assurances, Henry," he answered,
"that we are not robbers, even if we are outlaws."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Will you not see the messenger?" asked the young
Count. "They seem people of distinction."</p>

<p class='c000'>The two turned back across the fields to the outskirts
of the camp where the messenger waited; he was a young
Frenchman, well set up and armed, he seemed a squire or
upper servant.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is the Prince of Orange," said Henry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fellow pulled off his cap.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I salute Your Highness," he said rather defiantly.
"And, as your intentions in this country are not known,
I am here to know if the ladies under my care may pass
your encampment?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You should need no assurance," replied the Prince
coldly. "You know who I am."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Frenchman remained obstinate, though he flushed
a little under the rebuke.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The ladies I escort are nuns‚Äîan abbess and her
train," he replied, "and Your Highness is a heretic and
rumoured to be joining Cond√©‚Äî‚Äî"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah," smiled William. "You think the heretics war
on women as the Papists do? Go and tell your mistress
that she has my word for her safety," he added carelessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man left them and galloped back to the road.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who is the abbess?" asked William of his brother.
"Have you seen her?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No, only a cloud of women and servants on mules in
the distance, all chattering with fright. I think the abbess
is some great lady on a visit to a noble kinswoman."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince was returning to the camp when Louis
galloped up, begging him to see the nuns go by.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us salute them," he said, "and show them that
heretics are not boors."</p>

<p class='c000'>The three brothers rode back to the road, skirting the
hawthorn copse, and reined up under a delicate group of
young beech trees.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>A little dust, a little chatter and trampling, jingle and
clatter of harness, and the cavalcade came into view,
preceded by the stout French man-at-arms and a number
of armed men-servants.</p>

<p class='c000'>Directly behind them and riding in front of a group of
nuns came the abbess.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was mounted on a fine white palfrey, her habit was
largely white though she wore a black cloak; doeskin
gloves covered her hands, and she guided the horse with
glittering scarlet reins.</p>

<p class='c000'>On her breast sparkled a large gold cross, and a rosary
of carved gold beads hung at her waist cord.</p>

<p class='c000'>She sat very upright, in no way hampered by the full
robes which concealed her figure and fell over the horse
almost to the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her attention was instantly attracted by the three
young men under the trees; she raised her hand for the
procession to halt, and said in a very sure clear voice‚Äî</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is one of these gentlemen the Prince of Orange?"</p>

<p class='c000'>As she named the great heretic the nuns shuddered and
murmured; the men, though they halted obediently,
frowned. William came forward a pace from his brothers;
his slight figure, partially armed in steel, sat motionless
on his grey horse; he was bare-headed, and his hair blew
across his forehead; every line of his dark tired face
was clear in the unshaded sunlight.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am he, Madame," he answered, and he looked at her
curiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>The abbess returned his gaze steadily; there was in her
look the same serene steadiness as had sounded in her
voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was very young, little more than a child, though the
white framing her face, the demure nun's robe, gave her an
air of gravity; her face was pale and delicate, the features
irregular and attractive, the mouth sweet, the eyes large,
dark, beautiful, and wistful.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was wistfulness in her tone when she spoke again.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>"I have heard so much of Monseigneur, even in our
convent. I thank Monseigneur for his courtesy in allowing
our passage."</p>

<p class='c000'>When she spoke thus, gravely in her pretty French, she
was exquisitely charming, like a child masking in an elder's
gown, so little did she seem to suit her habit.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We are but soldiers of fortune, Madame," returned
the Prince; "it is not for you to thank me‚Äîthis is your
country."</p>

<p class='c000'>An elderly nun rode up to the young abbess and quickly
whispered to her that it was indecorous to hold converse
with the champion of the heretics and one going to join the
rebels against the King.</p>

<p class='c000'>The abbess listened without a blush, then again turned
her serene steady gaze on the Prince.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am Charlotte de Bourbon, daughter of the Duke de
Montmorency, and Abbess of Jo√ºarrs," she said, "so you
will understand, Monseigneur, why I cannot longer speak
with you."</p>

<p class='c000'>William understood; the Duke de Montmorency was one
of the hottest Catholic nobles and one of the chiefs of the
party against which Cond√© was struggling.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have been an abbess since I was twelve," continued
the nun, "and know very little of the world‚Äîbut I may
say, God keep you, and have no stain on my conscience."</p>

<p class='c000'>Without waiting for an answer she touched up her horse
and passed on, the little train of nuns rapidly following.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince was almost startled by the earnestness of the
abbess's last words, which seemed full of vivid meaning.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Had she not been a nun and Montmorency's daughter,"
he said, "I should have thought she blessed us."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is a sweet woman," remarked Louis, "that they
have stifled in that habit."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Prince watched the nuns go their way until the
turn of the winding road had hidden them, then went
back to the camp, to go his way of exile and ruin and
loneliness.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>He pulled at the hawthorn boughs as he passed, and
thought of Anne of Saxony.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I certainly am not fortunate," he remarked, with a
sudden smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is the future," said Louis hopefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah yes," answered the Prince. "The future and the
past‚Äîin both there is encouragement, though the present
be sad. Our task is clear before us and we are young."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And if we die young, God will be pitiful," said Henry
gravely, "and forgive us our sins because we were not
wise."</p>

<p class='c000'>Louis thought of Adolphus and of the inscription on the
blood-sprinkled banner that had wrapped him, "<em>Nunc aut
nunquam, recuperare aut mori</em>."</p>

<p class='c000'>William too had recalled his dead brother when Henry
spoke. He believed that the coming years held the same
fate for all of them, that neither they nor any who followed
them would escape the end which befell those who defied
Philip‚Äîthe end which had already overtaken so many
besides the young Nassau.</p>

<p class='c000'>But though the Prince of Orange was one who loved life,
he was neither regretful nor afraid.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
